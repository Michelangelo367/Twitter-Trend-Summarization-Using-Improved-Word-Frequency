"Investigations into the inter-district illegal abortion racket have revealed that the suspects were practising out of a clinic that did not have a valid licence from the local civic body and had used forged prescriptions for at least five years. The Solapur police bust the racket after a raid on a nursing clinic operated by Dr Shrikant Marda (68) at Mangalvedha in the district and arrested six people, including two doctors and a medicine supplier. Dr Marda, a child specialist, did not renew licence from the local self-governing body for the clinic in 2015, stating that he was not willing to run it due to old age. However, when police raided the clinic, three women who had been administered local anaesthetia were found and action taken. Senior inspector D B Patil of Mangalwedha police station told TOI, “Dr Marda did not renew permission to run the clinic in 2015. He wrote to the Mangalwedha municipal council that he was not willing to run the clinic due to old age. However, he continued to run the clinic without licence.” The officer said police records seized from Dr Marda’s clinic show that letterheads of a doctor couple were used to write prescriptions. “The letterheads belonged to a doctor, who passed away in 2015, and his wife. The 72-year-old woman doctor was shocked when we approached her for inquiry,” Patil said. Police have collected sample signatures from the woman doctor and those of her husband to match with the prescriptions issued by Dr Marda. The investigating team has also collected CCTV footage from Marda clinic, which is likely to provide further clues and arrest of more suspects. Patil added that the other arrested suspect, Dr Vilas Sawant, a homeopath, would use a portable sonography machine and also place orders online for medicines and injections required for performing abortions. “Dr Sawant, who is already facing three similar cases, used to order medicines online. We recovered his email ID and found that he had ordered medicines needed for abortion to the tune of Rs 54,200 in one year,” said the officer. Police have also arrested Suraj Babar (37), who has a clinic in Kadegaon of Sangli district. He has studied only up to the tenth standard and later did a course in naturopathy. “Babar used to go the house of women patients with portable sonography machine,” sources in Solapur police said. Patil said call data records of Dr Marda, Dr Sawant, Babar and the agent show that they were in constant touch with each other. The Solapur police have arrested Suresh Kumbhar from Karnataka, who would supply medicines to the doctors, and the husbands of two of the women found at Dr Marda’s clinic. Patil said police had recorded the statements of the three women who were found at the nursing home and X ray clinic, under section 164 Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC), which will be admissible before court during the hearing. Preliminary investigation found that all three women had female fetuses and had got admitted for abortion. Police have now focused their investigation on how the trio used to dispose of the fetuses after abortion. Police have also identified an agent who works as a technician in a pathological laboratory. Patil said the agent would soon be arrested","Investigations into the inter-district illegal abortion racket have revealed that the suspects were practising out of a clinic that did not have a valid licence from the local civic body and had used forged prescriptions for at least five years. «The letterheads belonged to a doctor, who passed away in 2015, and his wife.

"The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the state's interest in protecting the life of a foetus and therefore the ceiling of 20 weeks for abortion cannot be extended in a blanket manner. The government said that an unborn child cannot protect itself from the harm designed by his/her own mother. The Centre's reply came on a plea which has challenged the constitutional validity of section 3(2) (b) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 by which the ceiling of 20 weeks is fixed for an abortion. The petitioners have sought fixing of rational ceiling at 26 weeks instead of 20 weeks under the act. The petitioners have also sought quashing of a provision which restricts abortions only in case of saving the life of a pregnant woman. The Centre said that the legislature in its wisdom incorporated strict conditions for carrying out abortions, keeping in mind that the state was morally and duty bound as the guardian of its citizens and has the power to safeguard the life of a foetus in the womb after it attains the stage of viability. ""Petitioners on their right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the interest of the state in protecting the life of foetus in the womb, especially from the point of viability i.e from the period of 20 weeks onwards. ""It is a settled law that personal freedom of choice of an individual cannot curtail the freedom or choice of other individuals, specially the most vulnerable and persons who are defenseless. Unborn child cannot protect itself from the harm designed by his/her very own mother,"" the Centre's affidavit said. It said that several studies have repeatedly found that even in cases where serious abnormalities were detected after the twentieth week, pregnant woman who chose to carry the pregnancy to term were able to better cope with the loss, mental anguish and trauma as compared to woman who chose to terminate the pregnancy. The government's affidavit said that India's high maternal mortality rate is on account of woman seeking unsafe abortions beyond the prescribed ceiling of 20 weeks when no foetal abnormalities are detected. It said that ratio of foetal abnormalities detected in children is extremely rare and hence the same cannot be attributed as the reason for India high maternal mortality rate.","The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the state's interest in protecting the life of a foetus and therefore the ceiling of 20 weeks for abortion cannot be extended in a blanket manner.

"India has recorded over 61 lakh abortions in around last five years since 2014-15 till date, official data from states and Union territories in the health management and information system shows. Health ministry presented the data in the Lok Sabha on Friday in written reply to a question. Though the government data has not recorded illegally performed abortions, public health experts say up to 50% of total abortions are unsafe. The abortion data assumes importance because it reflects women – more particularly maternal health, as well as women’s reproductive rights and choices. Elaborating on the measures taken by the government to reduce unsafe abortions outside medical facilities, minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey told Lok Sabha provision of comprehensive abortion care (CAC) services is an important component of the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) programme under the government. The National Health Mission (NHM) provides support to the states and Union Territories for various activities to promote safe abortion. Provision of comprehensive safe abortion services are available at public health facilities round the clock, where trained medical practitioners are posted, the minister said. Comprehensive abortion care (CAC) has been developed and disseminated to the states and Union Territories, and certification of private and NGO sector facilities by district-level committees to provide quality medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) services. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules and Regulations, 2003, monthly reporting of total number of cases of abortions in prescribed format is mandatory which is sent from MTP sites to the district authorities. The states and UTs send compiled report on MTP cases to ministry of health and family welfare on quarterly basis.","India has recorded over 61 lakh abortions in around last five years since 2014-15 till date, official data from states and Union territories in the health management and information system shows.

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation. Pompeo leveled his charge amid an escalating crisis with Iran following a US drone strike on Friday in Iraq that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite foreign paramilitary and espionage service, the Quds Force. ""Iran has refused to join the regional and international consensus for peace and is, in fact, actively working to undermine the peace process by continuing its long global effort to support militant groups there,"" Pompeo said at a State Department news conference. Pompeo named the Taliban as one of the militant groups he accused Iran of using to undermine Afghanistan peace efforts. He also referred to the ""Tora Bora and the Mullah Dadullah Group,"" little-known organizations whose strengths, relevance and contacts with Iran were not immediately clear. ""The Taliban's entanglement in Iran's dirty work will only harm the Afghanistan peace process,"" Pompeo said. Tehran long has maintained high-level Taliban contacts. It has held consultations with Taliban officials on their ongoing negotiations with the United States on a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan that would lead to intra-Afghan talks on a political accord to end decades of fighting. Iran is a haven for some insurgent families and has supplied limited quantities of weapons to the insurgents to keep pressure on US forces near its border with Afghanistan, according to Western officials. But Tehran also maintains close ties with Kabul and regional experts cast its relationship with the Taliban as hedging its bets in case the militants return to power. Tehran also sees the Taliban as a counter force to Islamic State's Afghan affiliate.","US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation.

"After bearing the brunt of jihadist dynamite and looting by thieves, the archaeological treasures of Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are facing a new and possibly more daunting threat: climate change. Nestled in the heart of the Hindu Kush mountains, the Bamiyan valley's picturesque cliffs - where centuries-old Buddha statues were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 - still contain a network of caves housing temples, monasteries, and Buddhist paintings. The valley is also home to the silk-road era Shahr-e Gholghola fortress and the Shar-e Zohak citadel to the east. Experts say that a pattern of dry spells followed by heavy rain, and larger than usual spring snowmelts is putting this historic art and architecture at risk of destruction. Afghan officials warned in a 2016 United Nations report that the structures ""may collapse and suffer from severe erosion""due to conditions directly linked to climate change. ""The erosion processes are much faster, the rains more devastating and the wind erosion stronger, which has an extremely harsh impact on the sites,"" Philippe Marquis, the director of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan, told AFP. Marquis - who has explored and worked in the region for decades - explains that Afghanistan ""is very fragile geologically, especially as vegetation cover has greatly diminished"" due to deforestation. French imaging company Iconem concurred, saying Shar-e Zohak is ""very fragile"" due to erosion that has increased considerably over the last 30 years. For Baqe Ghulami, 21, who hails from Saikhand district in northern Bamiyan, climate change has long been a reality resident have had to confront. ""The weather is changing, now summers are warmer and winters colder,"" he says, while overlooking the empty spaces where the two towering Buddha statues once stood. Many of the artefact’s pre-date the arrival of Islam to the region but despite the fact they come from another religion, the residents who spoke with AFP proudly defended the area's history as their own. From the empty caves, visitors can see the Cultural Center, which began construction in 2015 but has yet to be completed. It aims to educate visitors about the urgent need to preserve the area's heritage. ""There is no benefit if people just see (the sites) without information,"" says Ali Reza Mushfiq, 26, director of the Department of Archeology at Bamiyan University, complaining that a dearth of funding has left many in the dark -- including his own students who lack access to books. The archaeologist readily admits that ""erosion is increasing"", but believes the real danger comes from ""human influence at the site"", including looters, who are rampant in Afghanistan. The Shar-e Gholghola Fortress and other key sites are now guarded to protect against such issues. The removal of landmines from the area has seen thousands visit in recent years, but the influx of recent visitors has done little to change the reality on the ground. ""We must start training... (the) local people to teach them how not to destroy the site,"" says Mushfiq, adding that some residents continue to store feed and house livestock in the historic sites. A stone's throw from the cave of the great Buddha, Ammanullah, 37, says he and his family have moved into one of the caves, building a home inside made of odds and ends with plastic sheets for windows. He is not alone, many other poor families have sought shelter next to ancient artefacts and structures. ""There are 18 families here... we didn't have other options,"" says Ammanullah. ""We would go if we were given a house."" For Marquis, however, the greatest threat does not come from local residents encroaching on the site or from theft. ""Even if it is dramatic, it is much less damaging than the destruction caused by erosion,"" he said. Mitigating the impacts of erosion and the effects of climate change would cost billions of dollars in Afghanistan, but the war-torn country has little ability to shoulder such a burden. The Global Adaptation Initiative, run by the University of Notre Dame in the US, currently ranks Afghanistan 173 out of the 181 countries it scored in terms of a nation's vulnerability to climate change and its ability to adapt.","After bearing the brunt of jihadist dynamite and looting by thieves, the archaeological treasures of Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are facing a new and possibly more daunting threat: climate change.

"The Consulate General of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Hyderabad was inaugurated on Wednesday. This will be the country’s second consulate in the country with the first one being in Mumbai. Afghanistan has its embassy in New Delhi. Stating that the establishment of the consulate will usher in new opportunities, Afghanistan deputy foreign minister Naheed Esar said: “While there exists air connectivity between Kabul, Delhi and Mumbai, we would like to add Hyderabad among the newer destinations in this corridor.” She added that economic ties between the countries would focus in sectors such as transit, energy and trade. Esar invited businesses from the city to establish bases in Afghanistan. The minister said the establishment of the consulate came at a crucial juncture for Afghanistan, when it is transitioning from being an aid-recipient country to a self-reliant one. Highlighting another dimension of Hyderabad’s relationship with Kabul, state home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali said that there were many Afghan students pursuing their studies here. Besides education he also stressed on the need to build trade ties including in traditional items. Charge d’affaires of the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, Tahir Qaadiri said that since Hyderabad was known to be an IT hub, it would be interesting to see a ‘silicon valley’ established in Afghanistan as well. “The inauguration of the consulate here will open south India to our nation,” he said and added that a Hyderabad-Jalalabad sister city partnership could be on the horizon.

"England paceman Jofra Archer may miss out on second Test against South Africa after skipping bowling practice at Newlands on Wednesday. Archer, who took six wickets in the first Test defeat at Pretoria including 5-102 in the second innings, did bat in the nets and took part in fielding drills but a sore right elbow kept him from bowling. A decision on the 24-year-old would have to be made just before the start of the Test on Friday. He had been a doubt for the first match after suffering from the virus that swept through the England camp on their arrival in South Africa but recovered in time to play in the 107-run defeat. For the first time on tour, England's entire 19-man squad were at practice on Wednesday including spinner Jack Leech, who has suffered the longest from the flu bug.

England have said they will support the idea after 2023 while Australia are to give serious consideration to the plan. Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported that South Africa would oppose the idea, despite the country becoming the first to host a four-day Test when they played Zimbabwe in 2017.

"In a marginal relief to airlines as oil prices shoot up, the aviation ministry has decided to discontinue levy of airport operator charge or fuel throughput charge at all airports, airstrips and heliports across India with immediate effect. It said Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) “should take into account the amount in this revenue stream and duly compensate the airport operator / Airports Authority of India by suitably recalibrating other tariffs during their determinations of airport tariffs.” The decision has been taken to “uphold affordability and sustainability of air passenger and air cargo transportation.” The ministry order says: “Fuel-related charges are charged variously either in three parts as (a) Airport Operator Charges, (b) Fuel Infrastructure Charges (FIC), and (c) Into Plane (ITP) Charges or as a composite of the three, generally called Fuel Throughput Charge (FTC), at the airports, airstrips and helipads across the country. At some airports, fuel supply is provided on open access basis. “Numerous rounds of stakeholder consultations have been held by the ministry in order to rationalise the present mechanism of invoicing of ATF fuel throughput charges.… It was seen inter-alia that the global best practices at airports avoid levying a double charge by way of land rental on fuel suppliers for the use of the land at the airport and a market access or concession fee for providing commercial opportunity when there is no underlying tangible service being rendered by the airport operator,” it adds.","In a marginal relief to airlines as oil prices shoot up, the aviation ministry has decided to discontinue levy of airport operator charge or fuel throughput charge at all airports, airstrips and heliports across India with immediate effect.

"For long a cauldron of hostility, the Gulf and Middle-East region is seething with renewed fury and prospects of an expanded war 72 hours into 2020 after the United States on Thursday assassinated a top Iranian general on President Trump's orders.

"Jeff Bezos met federal investigators in April 2019 after they received information about the alleged hack of the billionaire’s mobile phone by Saudi Arabia, the Guardian has been told. Bezos was interviewed by investigators at a time when the FBI was conducting an investigation into the Israeli technology company NSO Group, according to a person who was present at the meeting. Reuters first reported on Thursday that the FBI was investigating the role of NSO in possible hacks of US residents and companies, citing four people familiar with the inquiry. Reuters also reported that the FBI had met Bezos in connection with the alleged hacking of his phone. The FBI investigation into NSO has been under way since 2017, when officials were seeking information about whether the company had received any of the code it needed to infect smartphones from US hackers, Reuters reported. In a statement provided by the strategy firm Mercury Public Affairs, NSO said: “We have not been contacted by any US law enforcement agencies at all about any such matters and have no knowledge or awareness of any investigative actions. Therefore, we cannot comment further.” NSO has previously said government customers are the ones who do the hacking. Two independent investigators at the United Nations, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, revealed last week that they have launched their own inquiry into allegations that Bezos’s phone was hacked on 1 May 2018 after he apparently received a video file from a WhatsApp account belonging to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. The investigators are examining whether the alleged hack occurred in connection to Bezos’s role as the owner of the Washington Post. An analysis of the alleged hack that was commissioned by the Amazon founder has not concluded what kind of spyware was used. NSO said last week it was “shocked and appalled” by allegations that Bezos’s phone had been hacked. The company also said: “We can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance. Saudi Arabia has called the claim that it was involved in the hack “absurd”. A person who was present at the April 2019 meeting between Bezos and investigators said it took place at the offices of Bezos’s lawyer, Matthew Schwartz, at the firm of Boies Schiller Flexner. An attorney for Bezos declined to comment. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has separately referred a civil claim it filed against NSO last year to the Department of Justice. WhatsApp has said it believed NSO has violated criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law that is used to prosecute hackers. WhatsApp has claimed 1,400 users were hacked using NSO technology over a two-week period in April-May last year, after NSO was allegedly able to exploit a WhatsApp vulnerability that was later fixed. NSO has staunchly denied the claim and has said it would vigorously defend itself in court. NSO has faced scrutiny after multiple claims that its technology has been used against journalists, human rights campaigners, academics and high-ranking government officials. Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk school, which investigates hacking cases, said this week it believed the New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard, who has written a book about Prince Mohammed, had been targeted by spyware known as Pegasus, which is made by NSO. NSO has said its technology is used by clients to combat crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates claims of abuse of its technology. The company has previously denied ever being contacted by the US Department of Justice. NSO has also said its technology cannot be used against US mobile phone numbers, though WhatsApp has disputed that claim in its lawsuit against NSO. The Guardian has been told that federal investigators received further information about NSO technology in early 2019, including detailed information about how Pegasus works, ways the malware can self-destruct and become undetectable, and that it can automatically uninstall. New revelations about the alleged hacking of Bezos’s phone have caught the attention of a handful of politicians in Washington who have sought more information about the alleged hack, including whether there was any evidence that Saudi Arabia had infected phones of any members of the Trump administration.","Two independent investigators at the United Nations, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, revealed last week that they have launched their own inquiry into allegations that Bezos’s phone was hacked on 1 May 2018 after he apparently received a video file from a WhatsApp account belonging to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Jeff Bezos met federal investigators in April 2019 after they received information about the alleged hack of the billionaire’s mobile phone by Saudi Arabia, the Guardian has been told."
"THE CONSTELLATION ORION is one of the most recognizable patterns in the night sky, visible around the world. But if you’ve looked at Orion recently and thought something seemed off, you’re not wrong: The giant red star Betelgeuse, which marks the hunter’s right shoulder, is the dimmest it’s been in almost a century. Normally, Betelgeuse is among the 10 brightest stars in the sky. However, the red giant began dimming in October, and by mid-December, the star had faded so much it wasn’t even in the top 20, Villanova University’s Edward Guinan reported in an Astronomer’s Telegram. “Now the outline of Orion is noticeably different with Betelgeuse so faint,” he says. (See how many constellations you can identify with our interactive quiz.) To be clear, dimming alone isn’t all that odd for a star like Betelgeuse. It’s what’s known as a variable star, and its shifts in brightness have been closely studied for decades. However, it is unusual for one of the sky’s most prominent points of light to fade so noticeably, prompting scientists to consider the possibility that something more exciting could be about to happen: Betelgeuse might explode and die, briefly blazing brighter than the full moon before vanishing from our night sky forever. Huge, red stars like Betelgeuse live fast and die violently, exploding in stellar events called supernovae that are visible across vast distances. So, while Betelgeuse is a relatively young star—only about 8.5 million years old—astronomers know that it is nearing the end of its life. “The biggest question now is when it will explode in a supernova,” UC Berkeley’s Sarafina Nance, who studies Betelgeuse and stellar explosions, said on Twitter. “Disclaimer: I don't think it's going to explode any time soon,” she added during an interview with National Geographic. “But I am excited [for] when it does.”","Normally, Betelgeuse is among the 10 brightest stars in the sky. However, the red giant began dimming in October, and by mid-December, the star had faded so much it wasn’t even in the top 20, Villanova University’s Edward Guinan reported in an Astronomer’s Telegram."
"The star, Betelgeuse, is suddenly dimming. It may be a sign, astronomers say, that the star is about to explode. Another possibility is the red supergiant may just be going through a phase. Ed Guinan, an astronomy professor at Villanova University, was the lead author on a December 8 paper entitled ""The Fainting of the Nearby Supergiant Betelgeuse.""He told CNN that Betelgeuse (pronounced: BAY-tel juice) been declining in brightness sharply since October, and was now about 2.5 times fainter than usual. Once the ninth brightest star in the sky, Betelgeuse has fallen now to about the 23rd brightest. Guinan and his colleagues have been closely observing the star for decades, with ""continuous coverage since 1980,"" he said. In the last half-century, the star has never dimmed so aggressively, and that could mean we're on the verge of something extraordinary. ""What causes the supernova is deep inside the star,"" Guinan said. And because the star is so huge, it's impossible to tell what's going on so far down Betelgeuse is the star at the shoulder of Orion, the iconic constellation in the shape of a hunter wielding a bow in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Arabic for ""hand of Orion."" The star, which is about 700 light years away from Earth, is a relatively close neighbor within our galaxy. ""What's special about this is how close it is,"" Guinan said. Guinan said it's the most likely nearby supernova candidate. It's about nine million years old, and stars as large as Betelgeuse don't usually have lifespans past 10 million years. Though its time is nigh, it probably won't explode in your lifetime. ""It'll probably happen in the next 200,000 or 300,000 years,"" Guinan said. It's a variable star, which means it regularly dims and brightens, in cycles that can last about 420 days. Betelgeuse has been in a normal dimming period over the past few months, but it's just dramatically accelerated compared to past years. The dimming process should end by mid-January, according to mathematical models. But Betelgeuse often follows its own rules, he says. ""I personally think it's going to bounce back, but it's fun to watch stars change,"" Guinan said. However, he adds, ""If it continues dimming, then all bets are off."" If it exploded, it would be be bright enough to see during the day That might mean we're on the verge of a brilliant light show, because if a star this close exploded, it would make an impact. Stars rapidly fuse various elements in their cores. And if Betelgeuse burns down to an iron core, which won't fuse, that core could collapse rapidly, leading to a supernova. The red supergiant would glow a vibrant blue for three of four months, and would take about a year to fade out. ""It would be a really bright star visible in the daytime,"" Guinan said. There wouldn't be any direct danger to life on earth, but ultraviolet radiation from the celestial blast could scorch ozone in our atmosphere. Betelgeuse's curious behavior has stuck out in other ways over the decades. In 2009, the late astronomer and Nobel Laureate Charles Townes told CNN he had observed Betelgeuse shrinking 15% since the mid 1990s. Back then, Townes and his colleagues were puzzled because as stars usually get brighter as they shrink. Betelgeuse, however, was dimming. The star has been acting differently in the past few months, and it's anyone guess what all the unusual readings may mean. ""It might then be a very small bright star, or it might even be a black hole. An explosion would be very surprising,"" Townes said at the time.","The star, Betelgeuse, is suddenly dimming. It may be a sign, astronomers say, that the star is about to explode. Another possibility is the red supergiant may just be going through a phase."
"One of the brightest stars in the sky -- the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion -- has gotten significantly less bright than usual in recent months. And that's leading to excited speculation the monster star could soon go supernova. Astronomers from Villanova University in Pennsylvania reported earlier this month that Betelgeuse is at a ""modern all-time low"" magnitude, which is a measure of brightness. An update from the same team on Monday said that the star has continued to dim over the past two weeks: so much, in fact, that it has gone from being one of the top 10 brightest stars in the sky to about the 21st brightest star. One of two things could be happening here: Betelgeuse is a variable star that has been dimming and re-brightening for millennia at this point. We could just be seeing its most significant dip in the past half-century or so, which is less than the blink of an eye in this star's lifespan. Most of the scientists who have chimed in about the big red star in recent weeks on social media believe this is most likely what's going down. ""Stars in the later phases of their life go through a lot of variability that we can't fully explain yet ... It probably still has tens of thousands of years, if not 100,000 (left),"" astronomer Yvette Cendes of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics wrote Friday on Reddit. The other possibility is that Betelgeuse is finally out of fuel and it has begun to collapse in on itself -- a process that is expected to end in a spectacular supernova explosion. Rutgers University physicist Matthew Buckley also jokingly suggested that a highly advanced alien civilization could be to blame for Betelgeuse's recent dimming. ""No one is asking the real question: Is its dimming a sign that someone is finishing a Dyson sphere around it?"" he wrote on Twitter Monday. A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that a super technological society might construct around a star to collect a significant amount of its energy. Imagine something like massive rings of solar panels circling or even encapsulating the sun. Such megastructures have been suggested as possible, if highly unlikely, explanations for the odd behavior of other dimming stars and stars that seem to have disappeared from the sky. The star is hundreds of light years from Earth, which is close in terms of the cosmos, but far enough away that we don't have to worry about being caught up in a supernova blast. There are some interesting studies out that suggest life on Earth has been affected by nearby supernovas in the past, but even if there is some cause for concern there, the good news is that we'll see Betelgeuse blow hundreds of years before the blast reaches Earth. According to astronomer Sten Odenwald, it would be about another 100,00 years before what's left of the explosion and its highly energetic x-rays arrive, and we'll be protected from them by the magnetic fields of our own sun and Earth. When Betelgeuse does go supernova -- as most astronomers believe is inevitable -- it will be a huge show. The exploding star will be visible during daylight and might even be brighter than the moon at night. The last such visible supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova, all the way back in 1604, which was obvious during the day for over three weeks. Betelgeuse is at least 10 times closer to Earth and has a mind-boggling radius that would extend to engulf not only all of our inner solar system if it was put in place of the sun, but also Jupiter. A number of astronomers are making sure to throw lots of cosmic cold water of the notion of Betelgeuse going supernova in the near term. NASA's Eric Mamajek points to research finding the odds of the event happening in the coming decades at about a tenth of a percent and notes that accounts of the star's long history of variable brightening and dimming can even be found in Australian Aboriginal oral tradition. So, we're probably not going to get a second moon in the sky for the holidays, at least not from the direction of Betelgeuse. ""It's not even the star closest to going supernova -- that honor goes to Eta Carinae,"" Cendes says. Eta Carinae is a two-star system about 10 times further away that's already been erupting in its own spectacular death throes for decades now. It may actually be the next star system to light up daytime. Either way, keep an eye on the sky!",One of the brightest stars in the sky -- the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion -- has gotten significantly less bright than usual in recent months. And that's leading to excited speculation the monster star could soon go supernova.
