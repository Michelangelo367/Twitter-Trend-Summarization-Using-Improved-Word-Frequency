"Investigations into the inter-district illegal abortion racket have revealed that the suspects were practising out of a clinic that did not have a valid licence from the local civic body and had used forged prescriptions for at least five years. The Solapur police bust the racket after a raid on a nursing clinic operated by Dr Shrikant Marda (68) at Mangalvedha in the district and arrested six people, including two doctors and a medicine supplier. Dr Marda, a child specialist, did not renew licence from the local self-governing body for the clinic in 2015, stating that he was not willing to run it due to old age. However, when police raided the clinic, three women who had been administered local anaesthetia were found and action taken. Senior inspector D B Patil of Mangalwedha police station told TOI, “Dr Marda did not renew permission to run the clinic in 2015. He wrote to the Mangalwedha municipal council that he was not willing to run the clinic due to old age. However, he continued to run the clinic without licence.” The officer said police records seized from Dr Marda’s clinic show that letterheads of a doctor couple were used to write prescriptions. “The letterheads belonged to a doctor, who passed away in 2015, and his wife. The 72-year-old woman doctor was shocked when we approached her for inquiry,” Patil said. Police have collected sample signatures from the woman doctor and those of her husband to match with the prescriptions issued by Dr Marda. The investigating team has also collected CCTV footage from Marda clinic, which is likely to provide further clues and arrest of more suspects. Patil added that the other arrested suspect, Dr Vilas Sawant, a homeopath, would use a portable sonography machine and also place orders online for medicines and injections required for performing abortions. “Dr Sawant, who is already facing three similar cases, used to order medicines online. We recovered his email ID and found that he had ordered medicines needed for abortion to the tune of Rs 54,200 in one year,” said the officer. Police have also arrested Suraj Babar (37), who has a clinic in Kadegaon of Sangli district. He has studied only up to the tenth standard and later did a course in naturopathy. “Babar used to go the house of women patients with portable sonography machine,” sources in Solapur police said. Patil said call data records of Dr Marda, Dr Sawant, Babar and the agent show that they were in constant touch with each other. The Solapur police have arrested Suresh Kumbhar from Karnataka, who would supply medicines to the doctors, and the husbands of two of the women found at Dr Marda’s clinic. Patil said police had recorded the statements of the three women who were found at the nursing home and X ray clinic, under section 164 Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC), which will be admissible before court during the hearing. Preliminary investigation found that all three women had female fetuses and had got admitted for abortion. Police have now focused their investigation on how the trio used to dispose of the fetuses after abortion. Police have also identified an agent who works as a technician in a pathological laboratory. Patil said the agent would soon be arrested",Investigations into the inter-district illegal abortion racket have revealed that the suspects were practising out of a clinic that did not have a valid licence from the local civic body and had used forged prescriptions for at least five years.
"The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the state's interest in protecting the life of a foetus and therefore the ceiling of 20 weeks for abortion cannot be extended in a blanket manner. The government said that an unborn child cannot protect itself from the harm designed by his/her own mother. The Centre's reply came on a plea which has challenged the constitutional validity of section 3(2) (b) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 by which the ceiling of 20 weeks is fixed for an abortion. The petitioners have sought fixing of rational ceiling at 26 weeks instead of 20 weeks under the act. The petitioners have also sought quashing of a provision which restricts abortions only in case of saving the life of a pregnant woman. The Centre said that the legislature in its wisdom incorporated strict conditions for carrying out abortions, keeping in mind that the state was morally and duty bound as the guardian of its citizens and has the power to safeguard the life of a foetus in the womb after it attains the stage of viability. ""Petitioners on their right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the interest of the state in protecting the life of foetus in the womb, especially from the point of viability i.e from the period of 20 weeks onwards. ""It is a settled law that personal freedom of choice of an individual cannot curtail the freedom or choice of other individuals, specially the most vulnerable and persons who are defenseless. Unborn child cannot protect itself from the harm designed by his/her very own mother,"" the Centre's affidavit said. It said that several studies have repeatedly found that even in cases where serious abnormalities were detected after the twentieth week, pregnant woman who chose to carry the pregnancy to term were able to better cope with the loss, mental anguish and trauma as compared to woman who chose to terminate the pregnancy. The government's affidavit said that India's high maternal mortality rate is on account of woman seeking unsafe abortions beyond the prescribed ceiling of 20 weeks when no foetal abnormalities are detected. It said that ratio of foetal abnormalities detected in children is extremely rare and hence the same cannot be attributed as the reason for India high maternal mortality rate.",The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the state's interest in protecting the life of a foetus and therefore the ceiling of 20 weeks for abortion cannot be extended in a blanket manner. 
"India has recorded over 61 lakh abortions in around last five years since 2014-15 till date, official data from states and Union territories in the health management and information system shows. Health ministry presented the data in the Lok Sabha on Friday in written reply to a question. Though the government data has not recorded illegally performed abortions, public health experts say up to 50% of total abortions are unsafe. The abortion data assumes importance because it reflects women – more particularly maternal health, as well as women’s reproductive rights and choices. Elaborating on the measures taken by the government to reduce unsafe abortions outside medical facilities, minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey told Lok Sabha provision of comprehensive abortion care (CAC) services is an important component of the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) programme under the government. The National Health Mission (NHM) provides support to the states and Union Territories for various activities to promote safe abortion. Provision of comprehensive safe abortion services are available at public health facilities round the clock, where trained medical practitioners are posted, the minister said. Comprehensive abortion care (CAC) has been developed and disseminated to the states and Union Territories, and certification of private and NGO sector facilities by district-level committees to provide quality medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) services. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules and Regulations, 2003, monthly reporting of total number of cases of abortions in prescribed format is mandatory which is sent from MTP sites to the district authorities. The states and UTs send compiled report on MTP cases to ministry of health and family welfare on quarterly basis.","India has recorded over 61 lakh abortions in around last five years since 2014-15 till date, official data from states and Union territories in the health management and information system shows.

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation. Pompeo leveled his charge amid an escalating crisis with Iran following a US drone strike on Friday in Iraq that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite foreign paramilitary and espionage service, the Quds Force. ""Iran has refused to join the regional and international consensus for peace and is, in fact, actively working to undermine the peace process by continuing its long global effort to support militant groups there,"" Pompeo said at a State Department news conference. Pompeo named the Taliban as one of the militant groups he accused Iran of using to undermine Afghanistan peace efforts. He also referred to the ""Tora Bora and the Mullah Dadullah Group,"" little-known organizations whose strengths, relevance and contacts with Iran were not immediately clear. ""The Taliban's entanglement in Iran's dirty work will only harm the Afghanistan peace process,"" Pompeo said. Tehran long has maintained high-level Taliban contacts. It has held consultations with Taliban officials on their ongoing negotiations with the United States on a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan that would lead to intra-Afghan talks on a political accord to end decades of fighting. Iran is a haven for some insurgent families and has supplied limited quantities of weapons to the insurgents to keep pressure on US forces near its border with Afghanistan, according to Western officials. But Tehran also maintains close ties with Kabul and regional experts cast its relationship with the Taliban as hedging its bets in case the militants return to power. Tehran also sees the Taliban as a counter force to Islamic State's Afghan affiliate.","US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation.

"After bearing the brunt of jihadist dynamite and looting by thieves, the archaeological treasures of Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are facing a new and possibly more daunting threat: climate change. Nestled in the heart of the Hindu Kush mountains, the Bamiyan valley's picturesque cliffs - where centuries-old Buddha statues were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 - still contain a network of caves housing temples, monasteries, and Buddhist paintings. The valley is also home to the silk-road era Shahr-e Gholghola fortress and the Shar-e Zohak citadel to the east. Experts say that a pattern of dry spells followed by heavy rain, and larger than usual spring snowmelts is putting this historic art and architecture at risk of destruction. Afghan officials warned in a 2016 United Nations report that the structures ""may collapse and suffer from severe erosion""due to conditions directly linked to climate change. ""The erosion processes are much faster, the rains more devastating and the wind erosion stronger, which has an extremely harsh impact on the sites,"" Philippe Marquis, the director of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan, told AFP. Marquis - who has explored and worked in the region for decades - explains that Afghanistan ""is very fragile geologically, especially as vegetation cover has greatly diminished"" due to deforestation. French imaging company Iconem concurred, saying Shar-e Zohak is ""very fragile"" due to erosion that has increased considerably over the last 30 years. For Baqe Ghulami, 21, who hails from Saikhand district in northern Bamiyan, climate change has long been a reality resident have had to confront. ""The weather is changing, now summers are warmer and winters colder,"" he says, while overlooking the empty spaces where the two towering Buddha statues once stood. Many of the artefact’s pre-date the arrival of Islam to the region but despite the fact they come from another religion, the residents who spoke with AFP proudly defended the area's history as their own. From the empty caves, visitors can see the Cultural Center, which began construction in 2015 but has yet to be completed. It aims to educate visitors about the urgent need to preserve the area's heritage. ""There is no benefit if people just see (the sites) without information,"" says Ali Reza Mushfiq, 26, director of the Department of Archeology at Bamiyan University, complaining that a dearth of funding has left many in the dark -- including his own students who lack access to books. The archaeologist readily admits that ""erosion is increasing"", but believes the real danger comes from ""human influence at the site"", including looters, who are rampant in Afghanistan. The Shar-e Gholghola Fortress and other key sites are now guarded to protect against such issues. The removal of landmines from the area has seen thousands visit in recent years, but the influx of recent visitors has done little to change the reality on the ground. ""We must start training... (the) local people to teach them how not to destroy the site,"" says Mushfiq, adding that some residents continue to store feed and house livestock in the historic sites. A stone's throw from the cave of the great Buddha, Ammanullah, 37, says he and his family have moved into one of the caves, building a home inside made of odds and ends with plastic sheets for windows. He is not alone, many other poor families have sought shelter next to ancient artefacts and structures. ""There are 18 families here... we didn't have other options,"" says Ammanullah. ""We would go if we were given a house."" For Marquis, however, the greatest threat does not come from local residents encroaching on the site or from theft. ""Even if it is dramatic, it is much less damaging than the destruction caused by erosion,"" he said. Mitigating the impacts of erosion and the effects of climate change would cost billions of dollars in Afghanistan, but the war-torn country has little ability to shoulder such a burden. The Global Adaptation Initiative, run by the University of Notre Dame in the US, currently ranks Afghanistan 173 out of the 181 countries it scored in terms of a nation's vulnerability to climate change and its ability to adapt.","After bearing the brunt of jihadist dynamite and looting by thieves, the archaeological treasures of Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are facing a new and possibly more daunting threat: climate change.

"The Consulate General of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Hyderabad was inaugurated on Wednesday. This will be the country’s second consulate in the country with the first one being in Mumbai. Afghanistan has its embassy in New Delhi. Stating that the establishment of the consulate will usher in new opportunities, Afghanistan deputy foreign minister Naheed Esar said: “While there exists air connectivity between Kabul, Delhi and Mumbai, we would like to add Hyderabad among the newer destinations in this corridor.” She added that economic ties between the countries would focus in sectors such as transit, energy and trade. Esar invited businesses from the city to establish bases in Afghanistan. The minister said the establishment of the consulate came at a crucial juncture for Afghanistan, when it is transitioning from being an aid-recipient country to a self-reliant one. Highlighting another dimension of Hyderabad’s relationship with Kabul, state home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali said that there were many Afghan students pursuing their studies here. Besides education he also stressed on the need to build trade ties including in traditional items. Charge d’affaires of the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, Tahir Qaadiri said that since Hyderabad was known to be an IT hub, it would be interesting to see a ‘silicon valley’ established in Afghanistan as well. “The inauguration of the consulate here will open south India to our nation,” he said and added that a Hyderabad-Jalalabad sister city partnership could be on the horizon.

"England paceman Jofra Archer may miss out on second Test against South Africa after skipping bowling practice at Newlands on Wednesday. Archer, who took six wickets in the first Test defeat at Pretoria including 5-102 in the second innings, did bat in the nets and took part in fielding drills but a sore right elbow kept him from bowling. A decision on the 24-year-old would have to be made just before the start of the Test on Friday.

"In a marginal relief to airlines as oil prices shoot up, the aviation ministry has decided to discontinue levy of airport operator charge or fuel throughput charge at all airports, airstrips and heliports across India with immediate effect. It said Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) “should take into account the amount in this revenue stream and duly compensate the airport operator / Airports Authority of India by suitably recalibrating other tariffs during their determinations of airport tariffs.” The decision has been taken to “uphold affordability and sustainability of air passenger and air cargo transportation.” The ministry order says: “Fuel-related charges are charged variously either in three parts as (a) Airport Operator Charges, (b) Fuel Infrastructure Charges (FIC), and (c) Into Plane (ITP) Charges or as a composite of the three, generally called Fuel Throughput Charge (FTC), at the airports, airstrips and helipads across the country. At some airports, fuel supply is provided on open access basis. “Numerous rounds of stakeholder consultations have been held by the ministry in order to rationalise the present mechanism of invoicing of ATF fuel throughput charges.… It was seen inter-alia that the global best practices at airports avoid levying a double charge by way of land rental on fuel suppliers for the use of the land at the airport and a market access or concession fee for providing commercial opportunity when there is no underlying tangible service being rendered by the airport operator,” it adds.","In a marginal relief to airlines as oil prices shoot up, the aviation ministry has decided to discontinue levy of airport operator charge or fuel throughput charge at all airports, airstrips and heliports across India with immediate effect.

"For long a cauldron of hostility, the Gulf and Middle-East region is seething with renewed fury and prospects of an expanded war 72 hours into 2020 after the United States on Thursday assassinated a top Iranian general on President Trump's orders. The targeting strike was in response to his alleged role in killing ""millions of people,"" including attacks against American personnel in the region, the U.S President said, justifying his elimination.

"Jeff Bezos met federal investigators in April 2019 after they received information about the alleged hack of the billionaire’s mobile phone by Saudi Arabia, the Guardian has been told. Bezos was interviewed by investigators at a time when the FBI was conducting an investigation into the Israeli technology company NSO Group, according to a person who was present at the meeting. Reuters first reported on Thursday that the FBI was investigating the role of NSO in possible hacks of US residents and companies, citing four people familiar with the inquiry. Reuters also reported that the FBI had met Bezos in connection with the alleged hacking of his phone. The FBI investigation into NSO has been under way since 2017, when officials were seeking information about whether the company had received any of the code it needed to infect smartphones from US hackers, Reuters reported. In a statement provided by the strategy firm Mercury Public Affairs, NSO said: “We have not been contacted by any US law enforcement agencies at all about any such matters and have no knowledge or awareness of any investigative actions. Therefore, we cannot comment further.” NSO has previously said government customers are the ones who do the hacking. Two independent investigators at the United Nations, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, revealed last week that they have launched their own inquiry into allegations that Bezos’s phone was hacked on 1 May 2018 after he apparently received a video file from a WhatsApp account belonging to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. The investigators are examining whether the alleged hack occurred in connection to Bezos’s role as the owner of the Washington Post. An analysis of the alleged hack that was commissioned by the Amazon founder has not concluded what kind of spyware was used. NSO said last week it was “shocked and appalled” by allegations that Bezos’s phone had been hacked. The company also said: “We can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance. Saudi Arabia has called the claim that it was involved in the hack “absurd”. A person who was present at the April 2019 meeting between Bezos and investigators said it took place at the offices of Bezos’s lawyer, Matthew Schwartz, at the firm of Boies Schiller Flexner. An attorney for Bezos declined to comment. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has separately referred a civil claim it filed against NSO last year to the Department of Justice. WhatsApp has said it believed NSO has violated criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law that is used to prosecute hackers. WhatsApp has claimed 1,400 users were hacked using NSO technology over a two-week period in April-May last year, after NSO was allegedly able to exploit a WhatsApp vulnerability that was later fixed. NSO has staunchly denied the claim and has said it would vigorously defend itself in court. NSO has faced scrutiny after multiple claims that its technology has been used against journalists, human rights campaigners, academics and high-ranking government officials. Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk school, which investigates hacking cases, said this week it believed the New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard, who has written a book about Prince Mohammed, had been targeted by spyware known as Pegasus, which is made by NSO. NSO has said its technology is used by clients to combat crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates claims of abuse of its technology. The company has previously denied ever being contacted by the US Department of Justice. NSO has also said its technology cannot be used against US mobile phone numbers, though WhatsApp has disputed that claim in its lawsuit against NSO. The Guardian has been told that federal investigators received further information about NSO technology in early 2019, including detailed information about how Pegasus works, ways the malware can self-destruct and become undetectable, and that it can automatically uninstall. New revelations about the alleged hacking of Bezos’s phone have caught the attention of a handful of politicians in Washington who have sought more information about the alleged hack, including whether there was any evidence that Saudi Arabia had infected phones of any members of the Trump administration.","Two independent investigators at the United Nations, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, revealed last week that they have launched their own inquiry into allegations that Bezos’s phone was hacked on 1 May 2018 after he apparently received a video file from a WhatsApp account belonging to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Jeff Bezos met federal investigators in April 2019 after they received information about the alleged hack of the billionaire’s mobile phone by Saudi Arabia, the Guardian has been told."
"THE CONSTELLATION ORION is one of the most recognizable patterns in the night sky, visible around the world. But if you’ve looked at Orion recently and thought something seemed off, you’re not wrong: The giant red star Betelgeuse, which marks the hunter’s right shoulder, is the dimmest it’s been in almost a century. Normally, Betelgeuse is among the 10 brightest stars in the sky. However, the red giant began dimming in October, and by mid-December, the star had faded so much it wasn’t even in the top 20, Villanova University’s Edward Guinan reported in an Astronomer’s Telegram. “Now the outline of Orion is noticeably different with Betelgeuse so faint,” he says. (See how many constellations you can identify with our interactive quiz.) To be clear, dimming alone isn’t all that odd for a star like Betelgeuse. It’s what’s known as a variable star, and its shifts in brightness have been closely studied for decades. However, it is unusual for one of the sky’s most prominent points of light to fade so noticeably, prompting scientists to consider the possibility that something more exciting could be about to happen: Betelgeuse might explode and die, briefly blazing brighter than the full moon before vanishing from our night sky forever. Huge, red stars like Betelgeuse live fast and die violently, exploding in stellar events called supernovae that are visible across vast distances. So, while Betelgeuse is a relatively young star—only about 8.5 million years old—astronomers know that it is nearing the end of its life. “The biggest question now is when it will explode in a supernova,” UC Berkeley’s Sarafina Nance, who studies Betelgeuse and stellar explosions, said on Twitter. “Disclaimer: I don't think it's going to explode any time soon,” she added during an interview with National Geographic. “But I am excited [for] when it does.”","Normally, Betelgeuse is among the 10 brightest stars in the sky. However, the red giant began dimming in October, and by mid-December, the star had faded so much it wasn’t even in the top 20, Villanova University’s Edward Guinan reported in an Astronomer’s Telegram."
"The star, Betelgeuse, is suddenly dimming. It may be a sign, astronomers say, that the star is about to explode. Another possibility is the red supergiant may just be going through a phase. Ed Guinan, an astronomy professor at Villanova University, was the lead author on a December 8 paper entitled ""The Fainting of the Nearby Supergiant Betelgeuse.""He told CNN that Betelgeuse (pronounced: BAY-tel juice) been declining in brightness sharply since October, and was now about 2.5 times fainter than usual. Once the ninth brightest star in the sky, Betelgeuse has fallen now to about the 23rd brightest. Guinan and his colleagues have been closely observing the star for decades, with ""continuous coverage since 1980,"" he said. In the last half-century, the star has never dimmed so aggressively, and that could mean we're on the verge of something extraordinary. ""What causes the supernova is deep inside the star,"" Guinan said. And because the star is so huge, it's impossible to tell what's going on so far down Betelgeuse is the star at the shoulder of Orion, the iconic constellation in the shape of a hunter wielding a bow in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Arabic for ""hand of Orion."" The star, which is about 700 light years away from Earth, is a relatively close neighbor within our galaxy. ""What's special about this is how close it is,"" Guinan said. Guinan said it's the most likely nearby supernova candidate. It's about nine million years old, and stars as large as Betelgeuse don't usually have lifespans past 10 million years. Though its time is nigh, it probably won't explode in your lifetime. ""It'll probably happen in the next 200,000 or 300,000 years,"" Guinan said. It's a variable star, which means it regularly dims and brightens, in cycles that can last about 420 days. Betelgeuse has been in a normal dimming period over the past few months, but it's just dramatically accelerated compared to past years. The dimming process should end by mid-January, according to mathematical models. But Betelgeuse often follows its own rules, he says. ""I personally think it's going to bounce back, but it's fun to watch stars change,"" Guinan said. However, he adds, ""If it continues dimming, then all bets are off."" If it exploded, it would be be bright enough to see during the day That might mean we're on the verge of a brilliant light show, because if a star this close exploded, it would make an impact. Stars rapidly fuse various elements in their cores. And if Betelgeuse burns down to an iron core, which won't fuse, that core could collapse rapidly, leading to a supernova. The red supergiant would glow a vibrant blue for three of four months, and would take about a year to fade out. ""It would be a really bright star visible in the daytime,"" Guinan said. There wouldn't be any direct danger to life on earth, but ultraviolet radiation from the celestial blast could scorch ozone in our atmosphere. Betelgeuse's curious behavior has stuck out in other ways over the decades. In 2009, the late astronomer and Nobel Laureate Charles Townes told CNN he had observed Betelgeuse shrinking 15% since the mid 1990s. Back then, Townes and his colleagues were puzzled because as stars usually get brighter as they shrink. Betelgeuse, however, was dimming. The star has been acting differently in the past few months, and it's anyone guess what all the unusual readings may mean. ""It might then be a very small bright star, or it might even be a black hole. An explosion would be very surprising,"" Townes said at the time.","The star, Betelgeuse, is suddenly dimming. It may be a sign, astronomers say, that the star is about to explode. Another possibility is the red supergiant may just be going through a phase."
"One of the brightest stars in the sky -- the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion -- has gotten significantly less bright than usual in recent months. And that's leading to excited speculation the monster star could soon go supernova. Astronomers from Villanova University in Pennsylvania reported earlier this month that Betelgeuse is at a ""modern all-time low"" magnitude, which is a measure of brightness. An update from the same team on Monday said that the star has continued to dim over the past two weeks: so much, in fact, that it has gone from being one of the top 10 brightest stars in the sky to about the 21st brightest star. One of two things could be happening here: Betelgeuse is a variable star that has been dimming and re-brightening for millennia at this point. We could just be seeing its most significant dip in the past half-century or so, which is less than the blink of an eye in this star's lifespan. Most of the scientists who have chimed in about the big red star in recent weeks on social media believe this is most likely what's going down. ""Stars in the later phases of their life go through a lot of variability that we can't fully explain yet ... It probably still has tens of thousands of years, if not 100,000 (left),"" astronomer Yvette Cendes of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics wrote Friday on Reddit. The other possibility is that Betelgeuse is finally out of fuel and it has begun to collapse in on itself -- a process that is expected to end in a spectacular supernova explosion. Rutgers University physicist Matthew Buckley also jokingly suggested that a highly advanced alien civilization could be to blame for Betelgeuse's recent dimming. ""No one is asking the real question: Is its dimming a sign that someone is finishing a Dyson sphere around it?"" he wrote on Twitter Monday. A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that a super technological society might construct around a star to collect a significant amount of its energy. Imagine something like massive rings of solar panels circling or even encapsulating the sun. Such megastructures have been suggested as possible, if highly unlikely, explanations for the odd behavior of other dimming stars and stars that seem to have disappeared from the sky. The star is hundreds of light years from Earth, which is close in terms of the cosmos, but far enough away that we don't have to worry about being caught up in a supernova blast. There are some interesting studies out that suggest life on Earth has been affected by nearby supernovas in the past, but even if there is some cause for concern there, the good news is that we'll see Betelgeuse blow hundreds of years before the blast reaches Earth. According to astronomer Sten Odenwald, it would be about another 100,00 years before what's left of the explosion and its highly energetic x-rays arrive, and we'll be protected from them by the magnetic fields of our own sun and Earth. When Betelgeuse does go supernova -- as most astronomers believe is inevitable -- it will be a huge show. The exploding star will be visible during daylight and might even be brighter than the moon at night. The last such visible supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova, all the way back in 1604, which was obvious during the day for over three weeks. Betelgeuse is at least 10 times closer to Earth and has a mind-boggling radius that would extend to engulf not only all of our inner solar system if it was put in place of the sun, but also Jupiter. A number of astronomers are making sure to throw lots of cosmic cold water of the notion of Betelgeuse going supernova in the near term. NASA's Eric Mamajek points to research finding the odds of the event happening in the coming decades at about a tenth of a percent and notes that accounts of the star's long history of variable brightening and dimming can even be found in Australian Aboriginal oral tradition. So, we're probably not going to get a second moon in the sky for the holidays, at least not from the direction of Betelgeuse. ""It's not even the star closest to going supernova -- that honor goes to Eta Carinae,"" Cendes says. Eta Carinae is a two-star system about 10 times further away that's already been erupting in its own spectacular death throes for decades now. It may actually be the next star system to light up daytime. Either way, keep an eye on the sky!",One of the brightest stars in the sky -- the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion -- has gotten significantly less bright than usual in recent months. And that's leading to excited speculation the monster star could soon go supernova. 
"An outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan has put health authorities on high alert around the world. It’s led cities to be cordoned off, caused airlines to cancel flights to and from China and has disrupted global business. The World Health Organization declared a global emergency on Jan. 30 as the illness continued to spread, the same day the U.S. issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to visit China. The new coronavirus—named 2019-nCoV—is thought to have originated in the food market of the central China metropolis and has spread to about two dozen countries. Deaths and cases are likely to rise until the outbreak is contained. There have been two deaths outside of mainland China—the first took place in the Philippines on Feb. 1 and the second in Hong Kong was reported by local media on Feb. 4. China first reported the outbreak on Dec. 30. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital. Chinese authorities have restricted some travel to try and stop the illness since Jan. 23 and the country’s financial markets will remain closed until Monday Feb. 3 after the Lunar New Year holiday break was extended. Some cities and provinces have since stretched the holiday to Feb. 10, including Shanghai and Chongqing, while in Hubei the holiday will last until Feb. 14. In Wuhan, public transportation and ride-hailing services have been suspended, trains and flights from the city have been stopped and people have been told to leave only for essential reasons. Similar travel restrictions were announced in more than a dozen other Chinese cities, impacting more than 48 million people. Flight cancellations have skyrocketed since the virus’s outbreak. Nearly one quarter of domestic flights within China never took off on Tuesday, up from 1% a year prior. Most international carriers have announced plans to halt service to China. In the country’s largest cities, the number of flights dropped in half in the past month. Experts are worried that the virus’ mild symptoms will cause those who carry it to unsuspectingly transmit it too far and fast. A 10-year old boy was diagnosed with the coronavirus despite showing no symptoms. The virus has also been transmitted from two infected mothers to their newborn babies in Wuhan. While Ebola kills half the people who get it and SARS killed 10%, the new coronavirus’ mortality rate appears to be only about 2.2%, based on national data from Jan. 20 onwards. It’s still too early to tell how deadly this outbreak will end up being, but the number of patients released from hospital exceeded people who died in China for the first time since Jan. 23 on Saturday.",The new coronavirus—named 2019-nCoV—is thought to have originated in the food market of the central China metropolis and has spread to about two dozen countries. Deaths and cases are likely to rise until the outbreak is contained.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus that has killed at least 490 people in mainland China and two more elsewhere following an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. More than 24,500 cases have been reported worldwide, most of them in China's Hubei province. A man from Wuhan died in the Philippines on February 2 and Hong Kong reported its first death on February 4. The infection is now more widespread than the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which also originated in China, in terms of affected people but not deaths. What is coronavirus? According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These viruses were originally transmitted between animals and people. SARS, for instance, was believed to have been transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS travelled from a type of camel to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. The name coronavirus comes from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo. Under an electron microscope, the image of the virus is reminiscent of a solar corona. A novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and named 2019-nCoV, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Little is known about it, although human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. What are the symptoms? According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death. The incubation period of the coronavirus remains unknown. Some sources say it could be between 10 and 14 days. How deadly is it? Some experts say it may not be as deadly as other types of coronavirus such as SARS, which killed nearly 800 people worldwide, more than 300 in China alone - during a 2002-2003 outbreak that also originated in China. MERS, which did not spread as widely, was more deadly, killing one-third of those it infected. In China, however, the infection is more widespread than SARS in terms of case numbers. Where have cases been reported? Most cases and deaths have been reported in China - the vast majority in Hubei Province. So far, Hong Kong and the Philippines have reported a death from the new virus outside of mainland China. The virus has spread to many Asian countries, as well as Australia, Europe, North America and the Middle East. The majority of cases outside China are among people who recently travelled there. What is being done to stop it from spreading? Scientists are working on a vaccine but have warned one is unlikely to be available for mass distribution before 2021. Chinese authorities have effectively sealed off Wuhan, and have placed restrictions on travel to and from several other cities, affecting some 56 million people. The move was meant to ""resolutely contain the momentum of the epidemic spreading"" and protect lives, the central city's special command centre against the virus said, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Many airlines have cancelled flights to China, while some countries have banned Chinese nationals from entering and have evacuated their citizens from Wuhan. Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally. The WHO also says an animal source appears most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak. On February 2, officials in Hubei said the virus had a 96 percent concordance with an already-known bat-borne coronavirus. Chinese scientists previously mentioned snakes as a possible source. Is this a global emergency? The outbreak constitutes a global health emergency, the WHO has said. The decision to sound the top-level alarm was made after the first cases of human-to-human transmission outside China were confirmed. The international health alert is a call on countries around the world to coordinate their response under the guidance of the United Nations health agency. There have been five global health emergencies since 2005 when the declaration was formalised: swine flu in 2009; polio in 2014; Ebola in 2014; Zika in 2016 and Ebola again in 2019.",The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus that has killed at least 490 people in mainland China and two more elsewhere following an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
"Can individuals infected with the Wuhan coronavirus spread it to others even if they aren’t showing symptoms? It’s one of the most important questions confronting scientists. If even asymptomatic people can spread the virus, then it will be much, much harder to slow its spread. Doctors in China claimed asymptomatic transmission was possible, and a letter published Jan. 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine appeared to back them up. In the letter, scientists described a cluster of infections in Germany that had started with a traveler from Shanghai. The traveler had seemed healthy during her four-day visit to Bavaria, the researchers reported, and started feeling ill only after she boarded a return flight to China. That report heightened anxiety among scientists worldwide, who said the finding suggested that containment of the Wuhan coronavirus would be nearly impossible. But now health officials in Germany have raised doubts about the accuracy of that report. The visitor to Germany had “mild unspecific symptoms” while she was still in Germany, said Marieke Degen, a spokeswoman with the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s public health institute, headquartered in Berlin. Deaths in China Rise, With No Sign of Slowdown. The woman’s symptoms, including back pain, had been vague, and she had taken antipyretic medication, according to Bavarian health authorities and scientists at the institute. Antipyretic drugs are used not only to relieve fever, but also as painkillers and for their anti-inflammatory properties. Health officials reported their findings last week to the Early Warning and Response System of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ms. Degen said; their criticism was first reported by Science magazine. Whatever the inaccuracies in the journal report, many experts remain concerned about the potential for coronavirus to be spread by asymptomatic individuals, in large part because of anecdotal information received from their colleagues in China. This paper may or may not be flawed — it needs further investigation,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “But I don’t think it negates the concept.” “We had been getting reports from highly reliable people in China — scientists, investigators and public health people who we’ve known over the years — and they’ve been telling us, ‘There’s asymptomatic disease, for sure, and we are seeing asymptomatic transmission,’” Dr. Fauci said. Asymptomatic transmission is unlikely to be driving the epidemic within China, he added, but “it complicates our job.” Even if asymptomatic patients are spreading the coronavirus, the vast majority of infections will occur from patients showing symptoms, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization. Even if asymptomatic patients are spreading the coronavirus, the vast majority of infections will occur from patients showing symptoms, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization. Credit...Denis Balibouse/Reuter If the early symptoms include such common complaints as back pain, then infected individuals and their doctors are unlikely to consider the possibility that the patient is infected with a coronavirus, said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. “From a practical perspective, that is almost the same as if she had no symptoms at all,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “Headaches are very common, and the coronavirus is not the principal cause thereof, and they’re not observable by a third party.” If the first symptom is common and vague, he added, “then the public health challenge of figuring out who’s infectious is about as great as if it was truly asymptomatic.” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the World Health Organization, said Tuesday that the organization had been aware of reports of individuals who might have transmitted the Wuhan coronavirus before their symptoms appeared or very soon after being infected. But experience with other diseases indicated that many people who were believed to have been asymptomatic actually did experience symptoms. “It is possible that there may be individuals who are asymptomatic that shed virus, but we need more detailed studies around this to determine how often that is happening, and if this is leading to secondary transmission,” Dr. Van Kerkhove said. Whatever the answers to those questions, however, most viral respiratory infections are spread through the coughs and sneezes of symptomatic patients, experts say. The letter at the center of the controversy describes a healthy 33-year-old businessman in Germany who had developed a sore throat, chills and muscle aches on Jan. 24, with a fever spiking to 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit the next day, along with a cough. Before he became ill, he had met in Munich on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21 with a Chinese business partner. A resident of Shanghai, she had been in Germany from Jan. 19 to Jan. 22. The report said that she was healthy during her stay but got sick during her flight back to China. She tested positive for infection with the Wuhan coronavirus on Jan. 26. Chinese authorities alerted German health officials, and the businessman was tested and found positive for the infection. On Jan. 28, three additional employees of the German company tested positive for the coronavirus. Two of them had not had any contact with the woman from Shanghai. All of the infected were admitted to the hospital, where they were isolated and monitored. None developed severe disease. The authors of the report, researchers in Munich and Berlin, said it was “notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period” of the virus. The woman suffered only a brief, mild illness and recovered. Dr. Michael Hoelscher, one of the authors, told Science magazine that he and his colleagues had not interviewed the Chinese woman who had been ill, and relied on the accounts given by her German colleagues, who said she did not appear to have had any symptoms. Dr. Hoelscher could not be reached for comment. Researchers from the Robert Koch Institute and the Health and Food Safety Authority of Bavaria did interview the woman on the phone, Ms. Degen said, which is how they learned that she might have had symptoms. Julia Morin, a spokeswoman for the New England Journal of Medicine, said, “All we can say right now is that we are looking into the matter.”","In the letter, scientists described a cluster of infections in Germany that had started with a traveler from Shanghai.

"BlackBerry smartphones that are being sold by TCL Communication will soon say goodbye to the market as the Chinese manufacturer has announced that it would be parting ways with the Canadian brand as early as August this year. Existing BlackBerry smartphone users would, however, continue to receive after-sales services until August 31, 2022. In 2016, the Shenzhen-based company signed an agreement to manufacture and sell BlackBerry smartphones -- after BlackBerry decided to shift its focus from the smartphone market. The BlackBerry KEYone, BlackBerry KEY2, and BlackBerry Motion are amongst the BlackBerry handsets that are being designed, manufactured, and sold by TCL Communication in major markets. “The support of BlackBerry Limited was an essential element to bringing devices like BlackBerry KEYone, Motion, KEY2, and KEY2 LE to life and we're proud to have partnered with them these past few years on those projects. We do regret to share however that as of August, 31, 2020, TCL Communication will no longer be selling BlackBerry-branded mobile devices,” the company noted in a statement posted on Twitter. In December 2016, TCL Communication signed the licensing deal with BlackBerry to start designing, manufacturing, and selling BlackBerry-branded smartphones in global markets. That announcement was a follow-up of the revelation that the Waterloo-based company made by specifying its plans to outsource the development of BlackBerry phones in September 2016. Through TCL Communication, the smartphone market received Android-based BlackBerry phones, including the BlackBerry KEYone and BlackBerry KEY2 that both featured a physical keyboard alongside a touchscreen panel. The last phone that the Chinese company brought to the market was the BlackBerry KEY 2 LE that was unveiled in August 2018 and debuted in the Indian market in October 2018. TCL Communication in its statement mentioned that it was “blessed enough” to work on BlackBerry smartphones. However, some online reports highlighted that the company was frustrated and was set to give up for quite some time. Existing BlackBerry smartphone users are promised to receive customer service and warranty until August 31, 2022, adding ""or for as long as required by local laws where the mobile device was purchased."" It is unclear whether the customer service includes any future software updates, though. “The future is bright for both TCL Communication and BlackBerry Limited, and we hope you'll continue to provide support both as we move ahead on our respective paths,” the statement added. Apart from BlackBerry, TCL Communication has other licensed brands on board, including Alcatel and Palm. The latest move isn't likely to impact devices offered by those brands. TCL Communication was notably offering BlackBerry smartphones to select markets, excluding India. In fact, BlackBerry in February 2017 partnered with Optiemus Infracom to specifically produce and sell its Android handsets in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In Indonesia, it had tied up with BB Merah Putih. Gadgets 360 made several attempts to get clarity from Optiemus Infracom on whether it would continue to manufacture and sell BlackBerry smartphones in its operating markets. The company, however, didn't provide any explicit response until the time of filing this story. The last smartphone that Optiemus Infracom brought to the Indian market was the BlackBerry KEY2 LE. It also launched the BlackBerry Power Wireless Charging Pad in the country in March 2019. Given the ongoing circumstances, the future of BlackBerry smartphones is indeed in the dark. TCL Communication, nevertheless, may leverage its experiences with BlackBerry-branded devices to grow its native presence in the smartphone market. The company is already rumoured to have a foldable smartphone in the works that could debut soon to take on the likes of the Motorola Razr (2019) and Samsung Galaxy Fold.",BlackBerry smartphones that are being sold by TCL Communication will soon say goodbye to the market as the Chinese manufacturer has announced that it would be parting ways with the Canadian brand as early as August this year
"Everyone that grew up during the early years of this millennium knows BlackBerry. Often credited with being the world's first maker of the mainstream smartphone, BlackBerry has seen many a heyday, once holding over 20 percent of the global smartphone market and shipping more than 50 million devices every year. However, the iconic Canadian company missed the turn in the millennium that saw the rest of the world run helter skelter towards Android and the dawn of touchscreen smartphones inspired by the equally iconic Steve Jobs. After ceasing to operate its own brand of smartphones in 2016 and licensing its brand to TCL Electronics, BlackBerry has announced on Twitter today that it is severing its partnership from TCL. With no news of a change of hands in partnership, this may well be the end of the way for BlackBerry, once a behemoth in the world of mobile devices. The company has been in the dead, for all intents and purposes. Its last smartphone, the BlackBerry Key2 LE, was unveiled nearly two years ago. In comparison to the fanfare and near frantic hubbub that brands such as Xiaomi, Samsung, Oppo and other leading smartphone players generate, the Key2 LE came — and went — in comparative silence, perhaps speaking a lot about the recent state of the brand. As a result, the announcement from BlackBerry does not come as a surprise. What does strike out, though, is that BlackBerry is not drawing a complete end to its future trysts with smartphones. The company's statement on Twitter says that only its partnership with TCL has ended, suggesting that it remains open to the prospect of a new manufacturing partner, or a comeback in one way or another, in the coming years. That said, it seems unlikely that BlackBerry smartphones will ever be a thing again. While the ever shifting nature of technology means one can never say never, it seems unlikely that the brand will ever scale the heights it once did in the world of mobile devices. BlackBerry Limited will continue operating as it has, and given today's cybersecurity climate and the company's expertise with enterprise security, may see it being in and around the smartphone industry via software only. As for its devices in the market today, BlackBerry has announced that its partner TCL will honour warranties and service requests in respective markets. No word, however, has been said about software updates going forward. Is this the end of BlackBerry's round two, then? Going by information available right now, it certainly feels so.","After ceasing to operate its own brand of smartphones in 2016 and licensing its brand to TCL Electronics, BlackBerry has announced on Twitter today that it is severing its partnership from TCL."
"It appears BlackBerry phones may become a thing of the past. The reason for this is TCL Communications, the company that has the contract to manufacture and sell the BlackBerry phones says the contract is valid only till August 31, 2020. The company will stop selling BlackBerry branded phones post this date though it says it will support the devices sold till that date. TCL has been holding this licence covering practically the entire world. There are very few pockets where other companies hold the rights, but they are really not up to much in terms of making and selling the phone. The licence allowed TCL to design and manufacture the phones and sell under the BlackBerry brand. This ensured the brand stayed alive in the marketplace and kept the brand name in the minds and hearts of the user community. That may not happen now, unless between now and August, BlackBerry finds another manufacturer willing to take on the task from TCL. It has been reported that TCL has developed its own brand and will focus on that after it stops making and selling the Blackberry devices. Experts say TCL had done a decent job of making Android-run smartphones with attractive designs and trying to keep the original Blackberry flavour alive. None of these phones may have turned out to be runaway successes as a model in the highly competitive field, but they were not abject failures either. Indonesia India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh are the markets excluded from the contract TCL had for the BlackBerry brand.","The reason for this is TCL Communications, the company that has the contract to manufacture and sell the BlackBerry phones says the contract is valid only till August 31, 2020.

"India’s unity in diversity was yet again on display at Shaheen Bagh on Thursday as different religion and faith groups came together to organise an inter-faith prayer ceremony called “Jashn-e-ekta”. Cutting across religious lines, they, along with the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters, offered prayers for peace in the country. The first such event by anti-CAA protesters was held on January 12. Hawan, kirtan and prayers of different religions marked the second edition of “Jashn-e-ekta”. While hawan and kirtan marked the beginning of the prayer, several protesters were seen holding the Bible, holy books from different religions and posters of unity on the occasion. Religious chants reverberated in the air. “The government has been saying that we (Muslims) are the only ones who are protesting against the CAA and NRC. These inter-faith prayers prove that people from all communities are against these,” said a protester at Shaheen Bagh. Meanwhile, around 450 farmers from Punjab have also joined the protest in solidarity with Shaheen Bagh protesters. They will be staying there till February 8.

"The Delhi Police told a court here on Thursday that Kapil Baisala, arrested for firing in the air in Shaheen Bagh during an anti-CAA protest, was associated with a political party and the agency needed to interrogate him to ascertain if the alleged incident was part of any ""political conspiracy"". The probe agency further told the court Baisala did not do it in a rush of blood and it was a ""well-thought-out"" incident. The submissions were made before chief metropolitan magistrate Gurmohina Kaur who extended by two days the police custody of Baisala. ""I am of the opinion, two days further remand of accused Kapil Baisala, is necessary at this stage for proper investigation of present case in order to identify supplier of alleged pistol and for purpose of further investigation of the case,"" the judge said. Police had said on February 4 that Baisala was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party and he and his father had joined the AAP in early 2019. Additional commissioner of police Manoj Pant sought three days remand for custodial interrogation of Baisala on the ground that the accused was misleading the probe agency in locating the arms dealer and his laptop which has crucial evidence. ""He did not do it in a rush of blood. It was a well-thought-out incident. He raised slogans of ""Jai Shri Ram"" and ""Hamare desh me aur kisi ki nahi chalegi, sirf Hinduon ki chalegi (only Hindus shall have a say in our country, no one else) to mislead everyone. He fired two rounds in the air. He had purchased 13 cartridges in total. He is also not giving us the location of the other cartridges,"" the police said. The police said Baisala belonged to a family which has a political history. ""Accused has revealed his association with a political party and investigation of any possible conspiracy in alleged incident required to be probed. Time and place of the incident clearly indicate use of firearms at that particular place (Shaheen Bagh) seems to be a part of a larger conspiracy. ""During investigation, it has emerged that accused has political ambitions and active in politics. He belongs to a family which has a political history. Accused is to be further interrogated as to whether incident is part of any political conspiracy. Whole conspiracy behind this is to be unearthed,"" the agency said in its reply submitted before the court. It further said Baisala's father and brother have also been issued notices twice by the police for interrogation but they failed to come. ""He is not giving the complete address of one Sachin Tiwari, who allegedly supplied arms to him. Tiwari is a resident of Bihar and he needs to be taken to Patna to locate and identify the arms dealer. He is misleading the probe agency. ""His father and brother have not joined the investigation and deliberately avoiding it. Their phones are switched off too. We need to interrogate his friends too... Accused has to be taken to his relatives residing in Greater Noida, Meerut in search of them and thereafter they will be subjected to joint interrogation with the accused,"" the police said. It said further custody was required to confront Baisala with several chats, conversations, call records found in his phone. ""Data stored in the phone is voluminous and complete scrutiny will take more time,"" it said. Pant added that the accused was not giving the agency the passwords of his phone, his Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok accounts. When the judge asked Baisala where the rest of the cartridges were, he claimed he used them in marriages before. ""I have given them the password. My phone was open. The police locked the Facebook account,"" he said. The police said the accused was associated with different groups on WhatsApp. whose members were being identified at his instance. ""Some have been interrogated. Others need to join the investigation. They need to be interrogated at his presence... Call data records of Baisala's mobile phone is being scrutinised and he need to be confronted with it. ""He also need to be confronted with frequent callers and other suspects being identified and examined. Some mobile numbers are switched off and some are also not available at their residence,"" it said. Advocate Akhil Rexwal, appearing for Baisala, vehemently opposed the police remand and said the accused has given all information to the police, including the mobile numbers of his father and brother. ""If they can't locate him. it is not his fault. He is ready to cooperate with the police and join the investigation as and when called. He will give his laptop and all other materials required. ""This is a not a political issue. He himself had given to the police the form he filled when he joined AAP. He had joined AAP long back. The police is harassing him,"" the lawyer said. The police had earlier told the court that investigation has revealed that his WhatsApp account was purposely deleted. On February 1, Baisala had fired two rounds in the air in Shaheen Bagh, where an protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is being held for over a month now.","The Delhi Police told a court here on Thursday that Kapil Baisala, arrested for firing in the air in Shaheen Bagh during an anti-CAA protest, was associated with a political party and the agency needed to interrogate him to ascertain if the alleged incident was part of any ""political conspiracy"""
"Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday alleged that the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh was a ""joint venture"" between the AAP and the Congress, and asserted that the ""tukde-tukde gang"" would get a ""shock"" when the Delhi election results will be declared. The former BJP president, who held as many as three roadshows in different parts of the national capital on the last day of the campaign for the high-stakes Delhi assembly elections, said his party would emerge victorious in the elections as people will vote for country's security, development and good governance. Complete coverage on Delhi elections The controversial slogan of 'goli maro' was again raised during Shah's roadshow in West Delhi's Hari Nagar constituency where he was campaigning for party candidate Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. However, police stopped those who raised the slogan. ""Shaheen Bagh is the joint venture between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress,"" he alleged, adding that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were worried that Shaheen Bagh is being discussed. ""I want to ask them why the security of the country should not be an electoral issue? Why are the people sitting in Shaheen Bagh demanding 'Jinnah Wali Azadi' and why the tukde-tukde gang is supporting them? Shame on these people,"" he said at a roadshow in Seemapuri constituency in northeast Delhi. Asking people to vote for the BJP, he said, ""I want to tell all of you that tukde-tukde gang is going to get a shock because you are going to press the button on lotus symbol on February 8 for development of Delhi and the country."" Addressing the public in Bagga's constituency, Shah talked about the Pulwama terror attack and said Indian forces took revenge by conducting an airstrike. ""You all know that the people of Delhi, as well as the whole nation, was saluting the valour of the army, but do you know who was most unhappy? First Rahul Gandhi, second Arvind Kejriwal and third was Imran Khan sitting in Pakistan"". Shah said Kejriwal, Gandhi and Khan had a problem with the surgical strike. ""All three had a problem with the surgical strike. I want to ask whether such people should be handed over the power in Delhi? These people are very dangerous for the security of the nation. ""On the other hand, the central government is constantly working for the public interest, providing housing, gas connections and basic facilities to the people,"" he said. Alleging that the Kejriwal-led government has failed to deliver on its promises, Shah claimed that no work has been done in the last five years. ""Kejriwal has not done any work in the last five years. He had promised that 500 schools and 50 colleges will be opened, five thousand new buses will be added to the fleet. He even claimed that he will make Delhi a city like London. ""Today it is difficult to differentiate whether there are potholes on the roads of Delhi or there is a road in the potholes. On the contrary, they did not allow people of Delhi to take benefit of the schemes of the Central Government,"" he said, claiming that Kejriwal did not allow Ayushman scheme to be implemented in Delhi.","Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday alleged that the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh was a ""joint venture"" between the AAP and the Congress, and asserted that the ""tukde-tukde gang"" would get a ""shock"" when the Delhi election results will be declared."

"More than 130 centenarian voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in the February 8 election and they will be treated ""as a VIP"" on the polling day, officials said on Thursday. Earlier, the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) office had identified 150 centenarian voters but the number was revised after physical verification. Complete coverage on Delhi elections ""A total of 150 voters, aged 100 and above were initially identified by our officials. Later, physical verification was done but many of the centenarian voters were found to be dead, and some of them had shifted out of Delhi, so the final figure was revised,"" a senior official of the Delhi CEO office told PTI. After physical verification, the number of centenarian voters was revised to 132 -- 68 men and 64 women. The highest number of centenarians, 21, was found in West Delhi district and the lowest, 7, in New Delhi district, the official said. Kalitara Mandal, 110, a resident of CR Park in South Delhi's Greater Kailash constituency, is the oldest voter in Delhi. Bachchan Singh, 111, the oldest voter in the 2019 elections in the city who used to reside in Tilak Nagar, died last December. Delhi CEO Ranbir Singh on Wednesday said members of Bharat Scouts and Guides assisted the poll officials in physical verification process and ""documenting their stories"". During physical verification, officials check if such voters are alive or still living in Delhi. ""Of the 18 centenarians who were not found at home, most of them had died and some of them had shifted base from Delhi,"" the senior official said. Singh said these voters will be extended of all the facilities they had enjoyed in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has defended a contentious citizenship law his government passed as protesters continued to demonstrate against the new legislation that excludes Muslims. Modi took the stage at a rally in New Delhi on Sunday to launch his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s campaign for the capital legislative assembly elections in February. But he quickly turned to address the contentious law and the ensuing nationwide protests that have left at least 23 people dead.The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that was passed in Parliament earlier this month, allows Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally to become citizens if they can show they were persecuted because of their religion in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.Critics have slammed the legislation as a violation of India's secular constitution and have called it the latest effort by Modi's government to marginalise the country's 200 million Muslims.Modi has defended the law as a humanitarian gesture.The protests began in the northeast state of Assam, the centre of a decades-old movement against migrants, before spreading to predominantly Muslim universities and then nationwide.Alarmed by the rising violence, authorities have shut down internet and mobile messaging services in New Delhi, closed metro stations and cancelled permissions for large demonstrations.Earlier in the week, thousands of stone-pelting protesters battled police, who fired shots in the air and used tear gas, in northeast New Delhi.In August, Modi revoked the special status of the Muslim-majority Indian-administered Kashmir region, and in November, a court ruling cleared the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque razed by Hindus. And now, with the CAA, some are questioning the government's stance towards Indian Muslims, who make up about 14 percent of the country's population.","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has defended a contentious citizenship law his government passed.Modi took the stage at a rally in New Delhi on Sunday to launch his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s campaign for the capital legislative assembly.Critics have slammed the legislation as a violation of India's secular constitution and have called it the latest effort by Modi's government to marginalise the country's 200 million Muslims.Meanwhile, people continued to gather on Sunday outside the Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, where the protests first erupted."

In addition, five people were arrested and 13 police cases filed for posting “objectionable"" material on social media.Police have imposed a British colonial-era law, called Section 144, which bans the assembly of more than four people statewide.

"Amazon is a cloud computing giant and the largest American e-commerce company. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. Originally known for selling books through its website (and later digital versions via its Kindle e-reader), Amazon has built up a customer service, inventory, and shipping empire that allows the site to offer everything from clothes to lawn furniture to janitorial supplies. It also sells digital content like movies, music, and apps. Its Amazon Web Services arm is a multibillion-dollar provider of cloud-based services for millions of business customers around the world, including government agencies and universities. And it’s a major player in consumer electronics--not only by offering devices such as Fire tablets and TV boxes, but also via its Alexa AI assistant service, which made news at the CES 2017 gadget show by being built into everything from LG refrigerators to Ford cars.Amazon is even a Hollywood player, taking home two awards at the 2017 Golden Globes. Yet the basics of Bezos's business philosophy--focusing on long-term customer loyalty over short-term profits and never-ending expansion into new businesses--have been surprisingly consistent over the years. And Amazon's obsession with efficiency explains why it's now delivering products in just two hours via its Prime Now service, and why it hopes to be among the first e-commerce companies to deploy its own fleet of drones with Amazon Prime Air, a future fleet of autonomous aerial vehicles that will deliver packages under five pounds.In an interesting twist, Amazon has made significant investments in brick and mortar, opening its first bookstore in Seattle in late 2015 and since then expanding to 13 locations. In 2017, the company completed its acquisition of Whole Foods and in early 2018 opened an Amazon Go grocery store to the public at the company's headquarters in Seattle.","Amazon is a cloud computing giant and the largest American e-commerce company.

Future Retail runs 290 budget department and grocery stores branded ""Big Bazaar"".In a notice to Amazon last month, one of the sources told Reuters, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said ""in certain overlapping segments and areas of operation of the parties, the combined market share exceeds the threshold specified in the combination regulations"". The CCI also queried the procedure Amazon adopted to seek approval. Amazon had notified the CCI through a so-called Form I, instead of a Form II, which is more onerous and is required when parties determine the combined entity will exceed a predefined market share threshold.The CCI sought justification from Amazon on why it chose to file a Form I, the source added. Using that form could potentially delay approval of the deal. A Form I filing typically takes two to three months, compared to three to six months for a Form II.Amazon and Future Retail declined to comment, while a source at Future Group said it had recently answered the CCI's questions related to the deal, but did not elaborate.The CCI did not respond to Reuters queries.Additionally, CCI has asked Amazon more than 40 questions related to the deal and its businesses, the first source with knowledge of the matter said.A second source confirmed to Reuters that the CCI had sent additional queries to Amazon, calling it part of the regular deal approval process by CCI.""There are questions about e-commerce ... the CCI needs to assess whether there is any adverse impact on competition or not,"" the source said.Amazon's notification, available on the CCI's website, says the company believes the deal is ""not likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition"" in India.""Such queries mean the deal is being closely scrutinised and could face potential delays, but it can eventually sail through if no antitrust concerns are found,"" said Karan Singh Chandhiok, an antitrust partner at Indian law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan who is not involved in the proposed stake purchase.Typically in such cases, the company needs to defend its decision and, if the CCI watchdog disagrees, has no choice but to give more details in a Form II filing, Chandhiok added.",India's antitrust body has sought more information from Amazon.com Inc about its planned acquisition of a stake in India's Future Retail.

"Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday he will create an ""Amazon Council"" to protect and ensure the ""sustainable development"" of the world's largest rainforest, following intense criticism of his environmental policies.The council will be led by Brazil's vice president, General Hamilton Mourao, Bolsonaro said on Twitter, and will coordinate ""diverse actions within each ministry focused on the protection, defence and sustainable development of the Amazon.""Bolsonaro has said previously that his government is protecting the rainforest, but he wants economic development in the Amazon to improve the lives of its 30 million inhabitants, including its Indigenous tribes. Environmentalists fear that will hasten deforestation. Under Bolsonaro, the number of fires in the Amazon reached a 10-year high last year, prompting world leaders to denounce his environmental record.On January 15 MapBiomas, an environmental group that monitors the rate of forest destruction said deforestation of Brazil's Amazon rainforest threatens to accelerate and draw increased global concern since no new fire prevention measures have been taken in the crucial run-up to this year's dry season, according to Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of a group called MapBiomas that monitors the rate of forest destruction.""It would be expected that it will be worse than last year unless something really big happens in the next two or three months to avoid the high season of deforestation that starts in May,"" Tasso Azevedo told Reuters news agency.The number of fires in the Amazon rainforest increased 30.5 percent in 2019 from the previous year, while deforestation rose 85 percent, according to recent data released by Brazil's space research agency INPE.The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, is a bulwark against global warming because of the vast amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide it soaks up from the atmosphere. It also provides Brazil with hydropower, and its abundant rain provides irrigation-free agriculture.Risks to the forest sparked a public outcry in August when fires raged through the Amazon, drawing sharp international criticism.Last week, Brazilian Indigenous leaders issued a rallying call to protect the Amazon rainforest and its native tribes from what they called the ""genocide, ethnocide and ecocide"" planned by Bolsonaro.A manifesto signed on Friday at the end of a four-day meeting in the Xingu reservation said Bolsonaro was threatening the survival of Indigenous people with plans to allow commercial mining and ranching on their protected lands.Invasions of reservations by illegal loggers and miners have increased since Bolsonaro took office last year, leading to violent clashes. At least eight indigenous leaders were killed last year in circumstances that have not yet been clarified.","Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro said on Tuesday he will create an ""Amazon Council"" to protect and ensure the ""sustainable development"" of the world's largest rainforest.The council will be led by Brazil's vice president, General Hamilton Mourao.

"Brazil has seen a dramatic increase in the number of fires in the Amazon with more than 80,000 fires so far this year alone.This past summer, the world watched in horror as images of flames engulfing swaths of land in the world's largest rainforest came out, leading to global calls for boycotts over President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the crisis.The fires have come as deforestation has risen over the past years and is increasing even more as the Brazilian government weakens environmental regulations.New data recently released by the government shows that deforestation is at the highest point in a decade under Bolsonaro, with an area 10 times the size of New York City deforested since the beginning of the year.""The message that arrives on the ground is now everything is possible; we can keep on invading public land, we can keep on deforesting because it'll be forgiven,"" says Brenda Brito, a researcher at Imazon, an NGO dedicated to conserving the Amazon rainforest.Valuable trees are cut down first, the land is cleared with fire, and then the land can be used for cattle or soy, two of Brazil's key exports - or often, illegal mining.But even as deforestation worsens, the Brazilian government has weakened its environmental protection agencies. That has put pressure on communities already at risk trying to fight the destruction of the rainforest.Beyond the headlines of the fires, there is a violence that comes with the destruction taking place in Brazil.""We are receiving threats because we are trying to protect the forest. It is not only the trees that are coming to an end, But people are dying, giving up their own lives because of the trees,"" says small farmer Maria Marcia de Melo.Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a land defender, as the profits of deforestation combined with local corruption have led to a high rate of impunity.In the past decade, more than 300 people have been killed in the Brazilian Amazon over land conflicts.""These are very specific killings. It's the killing of the person who is standing up and defending the forest. That killing sends a message to everyone in the community - that if you do anything, that's going to happen to you. So the impact of the killings is enormous,"" says Cesar Munoz of Human Rights Watch.At stake are both the world’s largest rainforest as well as the lives of indigenous communities and small farmers trying to protect their lands.

"Democrats seeking to remove United States President Donald Trump from office via impeachment wrapped up three days of opening arguments late on Friday, urging Republicans to allow witnesses and new evidence to be part of the Senate trial.""Give America a fair trial,"" said Adam Schiff, the House of Representatives lead manager, at the end of his closing arguments before the Senate.""She is worth it,"" he added. Over three often-gruelling days of argument, the Democratic managers from the House of Representatives attempted to persuade members of the US Senate, who will ultimately decide Trump's fate, that the president is an out-of-control autocrat willing to sacrifice his country's national interest to further his own political ambitions.Trump was impeached on December 18 for abuse of power related to his dealings with Ukraine and obstruction of Congress for refusing to participate in the House impeachment inquiry. He has denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly called the impeachment a ""witch-hunt"". During the first hours of opening arguments on Tuesday, Schiff used video clips, along with screengrabs of text messages and emails, to construct a timeline of how Trump withheld nearly $400m in military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into announcing an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and the origins of foreign interference in the 2016 US presidential election.On the second day of their opening arguments, House managers honed in on the question of whether an actual crime has to be committed before a president can be impeached and on whether Biden's actions in Ukraine justified the Trump administration's demands for an investigation.Anticipating what is almost certain to be a central tenet of the Trump defence, the Democrats teed up a number of videotaped comments from constitutional scholars and even Trump supporters - Attorney General William Barr and Trump defence team lawyer Alan Dershowitz among them - stating in the past that a statutory crime was not a prerequisite of impeachment.""Impeachment is not a punishment for crimes,"" New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler told the body.

"A man who had travelled to Wuhan -- the central city at the heart of China's coronavirus crisis - was surprised when police showed up at his door after he returned home, asking to check his temperature.The man, who had quarantined himself at home in Nanjing, eastern Jiangsu province, said he had not told anyone about his recent trip to the city.But by trawling through travel data from Wuhan, local authorities were able to identify him and dispatch officers to his home last week, according to a newspaper article posted by the Nanjing government.As Chinese authorities race to contain the spread of a new virus, which has infected more than 30,000 people and killed more than 600 in China, Beijing is turning to a familiar set of tools to find and prevent potential infections: data tracking and artificial intelligence.Several Chinese tech firms have developed apps to help people check if they have taken the same flight or train as confirmed virus patients, scraping data from lists published by state media.In Guangzhou, southern Guangdong province, robots at one public plaza have even been deployed to scold passersby who are not wearing masks, according to the state-run Global Times.And in Beijing, one neighbourhood committee responsible for an apartment complex of about 2,400 households said they used flight and train data to keep track of everyone's recent travel record.""Use big data technology to track, screen priority (cases), and effectively forecast the development of the epidemic in real time,"" China's National Health Commission (NHC) told local governments in an online statement Tuesday.""Strengthen the information link between... public security and transportation, and other departments,"" it said, urging them to share train, flight, communication, and medical data.As Chinese authorities search for potential infections, a point of focus has been detecting fevers, a common symptom of the disease.While neighbourhoods and office buildings rely primarily on hand-held thermometers, public transport hubs are also trialling fever detection systems that use artificial intelligence and infrared cameras.In Beijing, a system developed by Chinese search giant Baidu screens travellers at the Qinghe railway station using infrared and face detection technology, which automatically photographs each person's face.If someone has a body temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit) or above, the system sets off an alarm -- prompting a secondary check by station staff.On Thursday, railway personnel, clutching red-and-white megaphones, ordered passengers arriving from northern Shanxi province to slow down as they passed by Baidu's system.According to the company, its system can check more than 200 people a minute, far faster than the thermal scanners used at airports.Megvii, an AI firm that was blacklisted by the US in October over alleged rights abuses, has developed a similar system, which is currently being used at a subway station in Beijing.""Having a team of nearly 100 people working together remotely from home hasn't been easy,"" said a spokesperson at Megvii in an emailed statement.""All of them are working around the clock during Lunar New Year public holidays,"" said the company, adding that the team had to optimise its models to ""effectively detect temperature with only the forehead exposed.""Besides fever detection, Chinese tech firms have raced to develop a wide variety of services to help with epidemic control efforts, from preparing drone deliveries of medical supplies to mapping the spread of the virus from Wuhan.Although the city has been under effective quarantine since January 23, some five million travellers left Wuhan during the Lunar New Year festival, according to the city mayor -- galvanising a nationwide search for recent Wuhan visitors.Still, the majority of tracking carried out by local authorities in China requires a lot of manpower, though some are entering data online to help with registration, especially as residents return after the holiday.In Beijing, some neighbourhoods are prompting residents to scan a QR code to fill out personal details, such as their phone number and hometown address.One form also prompted participants to fill out details on their mode of transport, such as their licence plate or flight number, if they had travelled.It also asked if they had ""recently"" visited central Hubei province -- where Wuhan is located -- or come into contact with anyone from the hard-hit region.","In Guangzhou, southern Guangdong province, robots at one public plaza have even been deployed to scold passersby who are not wearing masks, according to the state-run Global Times."
"The death toll in China's novel coronavirus outbreak has sharply risen to 722 with 86 new mortalities in a single day, mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province, while the total number of confirmed cases jumped to 34,546, Chinese health officials said on Saturday.Eighty-six deaths were reported in mainland China with 3,399 fresh cases from 31 provincial-level regions, the country's National Health Commission said.Among the deaths, 81 are in Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, two in Heilongjiang, as well as one in Beijing, Henan and Gansu, the commission said.By the end of Friday, 26 confirmed cases, including one death, have been reported in Hong Kong. Macao reported 10 cases, while Taiwan reported 16 cases, it said.A total of 4,214 new suspected cases were reported and 1,280 patients became seriously ill, and 510 people were discharged from hospital after recovery, according to the commission.It added that 6,101 patients remained in severe condition, and 27,657 people were suspected of being infected with the virus. As many as 2,050 people have been discharged from hospital after recovery.The commission said 3.45 lakh 'close contacts' have been traced, adding that among them, 26,702 were discharged from medical observation on Friday. Over 1.89 lakh others are still under medical observation.The death toll of the coronavirus cases overseas went up 220 with Japan reporting 86 followed by 33 in Singapore.Kerala has reported three cases while 647 evacuated Indians from Wuhan are going through quarantine in Manesar.Meanwhile, Wuhan began combing communities to ensure every confirmed or suspected patient is located and attended to as a senior official vowed to nail any official deserter ""to history's pillar of shame.""A conference on epidemic control on Thursday ordered the megacity with a population of over 11 million to make all-out efforts to locate patients confirmed or suspected to be infected with the virus, close contacts of confirmed cases, as well as patients with fever.Once identified, these people must be treated or placed in quarantine in a timely manner, the conference said, adding that ""no family or individual shall be neglected,"" state-run Xinhua news agency reported.City officials said checkpoints are being set up outside every community and apartment building to measure residents' body temperatures, while community workers and volunteers are paying house-to-house visits to conduct checks.Fever patients found in the process will be escorted to community clinics, which will decide whether they should be quarantined at home or be sent to other isolation areas. Police will step in if a patient refuses to obey quarantine rules and all persuasion fails, officials said.Chinese health officials have sent more than 11,000 medics, including the country's best ICU staff, to the city of Wuhan.Among them, over 3,000 doctors and nurses are intensive care specialists, Guo Yanhong, an official with the National Health Commission, told media here.""We are fully aware of the urgent need for ICU professionals in Wuhan.

"The first defence witness in Harvey Weinstein's rape trial acknowledged on Thursday sending messages to the former producer in which he disparaged the ""dog pile of actresses"" who had accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.Writer Paul Feldsher testified for the defence that actress Annabella Sciorra told him in the early 1990s that she had a sexual encounter with Weinstein but did not say she had been raped.Under cross-examination by prosecutors, Feldsher, who was a friend of Sciorra's, acknowledged that he had been in regular contact with Weinstein since allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against the former producer.""I think the dog pile of actresses who are suddenly brave and recalling repressed memories is hideous,"" Feldsher wrote in one text to Weinstein. Dog pile is a slang term sometimes used to describe mass bullying of one person by a large group.""I stand by the description,"" he said of the text on Thursday.Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann and to sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi. Since 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.Weinstein, who produced films including ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" has denied any nonconsensual sex.His trial is a key moment in the #MeToo movement in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media and politics of sexual misconduct.Sciorra testified on Jan. 24 that Weinstein forced his way into her apartment on a winter night in 1993 or 1994 and violently raped her. Though that allegation is too old to be charged as a separate crime, prosecutors hope it will show Weinstein is a repeat sexual predator, the charge that could put him in prison for life.Feldsher was the first witness called by Weinstein, after the prosecution rested its case earlier on Thursday.Under direct examination, Feldsher said Sciorra told him she had ""done this crazy thing with Harvey,"" and that he understood her to mean that she had ""fooled around with him."" Feldsher said that they did not discuss it further, and that he had no indication it was a negative experience.During cross-examining by prosecutors, Feldsher said he had stayed in touch with Weinstein because he ""felt badly that he was completely abandoned.""He acknowledged sending Weinstein text messages disparaging Sciorra in harsh language, calling her ""full of shit"" and ""an asshole.""""Well the rape version got her an agent at (Creative Artists Agency), so there's that,"" he said in one text.Feldsher seemed surprised when presented with his messages by prosecutors.""I'm learning a lot now and I had no idea my text messages would end up in a courtroom,"" he said.Feldsher also sent Weinstein texts criticizing his behavior with women, telling him, ""If a lot of these girls had been my daughter I would have wanted to beat the shit out of you.""He said Thursday he thought Weinstein was a sex addict but did not believe the former producer was capable of committing the crimes of which he has been accused.Weinstein's defence case is expected to continue Friday with testimony from Warren Leight, a director and producer who worked with Sciorra in the 1990s, and from Elizabeth Loftus, a psychology professor at the University of California, Irvine who will testify as an expert on memory.","Since 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. His trial is a key moment in the #MeToo movement in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media and politics of sexual misconduct."
"A psychologist called by Harvey Weinstein's defense team said memories of an incident can become ""contaminated"" over time by new information, as testimony in his rape trial entered its closing stages on Friday. Elizabeth Loftus, a University of California, Irvine professor, said leading questioning about an event sometimes causes a ""misinformation effect,"" where false details are incorporated into someone's memory. ""If you are urged to remember more, in trying to produce more to satisfy that situation, you may produce something like a guess and then it starts to feel like a memory,"" she testified. Since testimony began on January 22, six women have taken the stand to say they were sexually assaulted by Weinstein. All of the allegations against the former Hollywood titan are at least six years old, while one of them dates back three decades. Weinstein, 67, faces life imprisonment if convicted of predatory sexual assault charges related to ex-actress Jessica Mann and former production assistant Mimi Haleyi. Mann says Weinstein raped her in March 2013 while Haleyi alleges he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The defense says the women willingly had sex to advance their own careers and that Weinstein was in relationships with them. Mann admitted to the court that she had had 'non-coerced' sexual contact with Weinstein, producer up to 2016. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein made headlines worldwide in October 2017, igniting the #MeToo movement. Loftus who testified in about 300 trials, mostly for the defense said media coverage can lead people to change their recollection of an incident. ""If it is relabeled, it can be remembered as more upsetting and traumatic than it was at the time,"" she said. ""It does not mean the person is lying but their memory could have been transformed,"" Loftus added. The psychologist said memory can also be distorted from the start by alcohol or drugs, particularly Valium, a sedative. Actress Annabella Sciorra testified that she was taking Valium around the time she says Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s. Under cross-examination Loftus said that for traumatic events it is mostly ""peripheral memories"" that become distorted, ""not the core of the event."" The prosecution rested its case on Thursday and closing arguments are expected next week, well ahead of schedule. The trial has raised complicated issues surrounding consent for the jury of 12 to grapple with. ""It was much more clear-cut in the Bill Cosby case. He drugged the victim,"" said Pace University law professor Bennett Gershman, referring to the US comedian convicted of sexual assault in 2018. The jury must reach a unanimous verdict. If it can't then the judge may be forced to declare a mistrial. ""It takes just one juror to say, 'I don't buy it,'"" said criminal defense lawyer Julie Rendalman. ""I think it's going to be difficult to reach a verdict,"" she added.","A psychologist called by Harvey Weinstein's defense team said memories of an incident can become “contaminated” over time by new information, as testimony in his rape trial entered its closing stages on Friday."
"One woman accused Harvey Weinstein of forcing oral sex on her in his Manhattan apartment, even as she protested. She continued to see him, send friendly messages and seek work from him. A second woman said Weinstein, the one-time Hollywood titan, raped her in a midtown Manhattan hotel room. She maintained a sexual relationship with him for years, she said, to save her career. Two other women accusing him of sexual assault were waitresses who wanted to become actresses. One said she agreed to meet Weinstein about a film role after he had masturbated in front of her in a club. The other said she met him to talk about a script after he had reached up her skirt and touched her genitals during their first encounter. The prosecution rested its case against Weinstein on Thursday after graphic, first-person testimony from six women who said the producer had sexually assaulted them. But the district attorney's office has to overcome a significant hurdle: The two main witnesses against Weinstein maintained friendships with him after the alleged assaults, even having some consensual sexual encounters. Other accusers ignored his sexual misconduct and saw him again in the hope of getting work. That places a burden on prosecutors. They must explain to the jury of seven men and five women why some of the women continued to see him. ""It's confusing for the jury that they're being told they"" — Weinstein's accusers — ""were devastated by the crime and then they ask, 'When do I get to see you next?'"" said Matthew Galluzzo, a New York defense lawyer and a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor. Weinstein's lawyers are calling several witnesses to the stand to bolster his position that the relationships were consensual and in some cases transactional. Some of the women, the lawyers said, wanted to advance their own careers and use Weinstein to do so. ""You'll see they had a relationship,"" Damon Cheronis, a defense lawyer, said in his opening statement. ""You will see that sex was involved."" The trial is largely seen as a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement, a rebuke of decades of sexual harassment and abuse by men against women in the workplace, focusing attention on complex issues of consent and power dynamics. For weeks, Weinstein, who is 67 and recently had back surgery, has sat at the defense table, seemingly frail, slightly hunched and worn. He has used a walker to get around. It is an image that prosecutors have sought to counter. Weinstein, they told jurors, was a giant in Hollywood, known for Oscar-winning films including ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" who had used his influence and physicality to overpower and coerce women into sexual encounters. Two of the women who testified against Weinstein — Annabella Sciorra and Lauren Young — never contacted him again. Sciorra, an actress, said Weinstein barged into her own New York City apartment and raped her in the early 1990s. Young, a model, said Weinstein groped her breast in a hotel bathroom in Los Angeles while masturbating. At the heart of the criminal indictment are allegations made by two women: Miriam Haley, a former production assistant who said the producer forced oral sex on her inside of his home in 2006, and Jessica Mann, a former actress who accused him of raping her in a midtown Manhattan hotel in 2013. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty in state Supreme Court in Manhattan to five felony counts including criminal sexual assault, rape and predatory sexual assault. Testimony from Sciorra, known for her work in ""The Sopranos,"" is meant to support the predatory sexual assault charge, which requires that prosecutors show that the movie mogul committed a serious sex crime against at least two women. Weinstein faces up to life in prison if convicted on that charge. Young and two other women, Dawn Dunning and Tarale Wulff, recounted for the jury their encounters with Weinstein under a state law that allows testimony about ""prior bad acts"" to demonstrate a pattern of behavior. Prosecutors have said that Weinstein tricked young women into meeting with him under the impression he intended to help their careers. The Manhattan district attorney's case rests almost entirely on the women's testimony. None of them reported the attacks to the police at the time, and there is little physical or forensic evidence to support their claims, beyond photographs of the defendant that are being used to corroborate their descriptions of his body. It is a case, said Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor, that turns on a single question: ""Do you believe the women?"" Defense lawyers used their cross-examinations to suggest that the witnesses had consented. On Thursday, the defense called Paul Feldsher, a former film producer, who recalled Sciorra telling him in the early 1990s on a walk in Manhattan that she had awkward sex with Weinstein but not that she had been raped. ""I remember Annabella saying to me that she'd done this crazy thing with Harvey,"" he said. Then he added, ""My understanding was that she fooled around with him."" For their part, prosecutors are banking that the women's accounts will support one another and establish a pattern of predatory behavior. A similar tactic proved effective in Bill Cosby's second sexual assault trial, in which he was convicted after five women testified. ""It may be easy to be skeptical of one or two reports,"" said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor, ""but as the reports pile up, it becomes hard for a thinking person to think that all of these reporters are lying."" From the start, prosecutors have tried to portray Weinstein as a calculating predator who groomed and targeted women he believed he could easily manipulate. His accusers, they say, fit that profile: Mann was a naive, aspiring actress who fled an abusive home on a dairy farm in Washington state, and Haley was a financially struggling production assistant from Sweden who had a tough childhood. Weinstein, who had walked red carpets around the world and rubbed elbows with Bill and Hillary Clinton, overawed his accusers, prosecutors said. Most of the women were not famous — with the exception of Sciorra — or financially secure, and they had few or no ties to their families. ""The power and balance he deviously exploited was not just physical, it was also professional and profoundly psychological,"" one of the prosecutors, Meghan Hast, said in her opening statement. ""You will see how that dynamic often causes victims to act in ways a layperson might not generally expect."" The women's accounts shared several similarities: Weinstein allegedly lured them to his home or a hotel room with the promise of an acting role or a job, then cornered them into a bedroom or bathroom, demanded that they undress — even as they protested — and coerced them into a sexual act, using physical and verbal intimidation. ""I had this dynamic with Harvey where I felt like I always had to obey and jump,"" Mann said Monday during cross-examination. Under earlier questioning, she told his lawyers, ""When he heard the word 'no' and you can't give him what he wanted — that is when this monster would come out."" Mann testified that she had maintained a yearslong relationship with Weinstein after he had forced oral sex on her during a meeting at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California. She said she had engaged in a number of consensual sexual encounters with him before and after the alleged rape in March 2013 at the Doubletree Hotel in midtown Manhattan until as late as 2016. ""I know the history of my relationship with him,"" she said this week. ""I know it is complicated and different, but it does not change the fact that he raped me."" Weinstein's lawyers have noted that Mann had sent dozens of friendly emails to him, which, according to the lawyers, suggest that the two were in a romantic relationship and that Mann's allegation that she was raped is false. In one email, she told him that he should meet her mother. In a 2014 email to a former boyfriend, Mann wrote that Weinstein had given her ""all of the validation she had ever needed."" Similarly, Haley, who legally changed her name from Mimi Haleyi, said she, too, had tried to maintain ""a professional connection"" with Weinstein. She said she continued to share scripts, pitch projects, seek work and accept tickets to movie premieres after the producer had forced oral sex on her. His lawyers suggested she was using Weinstein. A forensic psychiatrist, Barbara Ziv, testified for the prosecution that it is common for victims of a sexual assault to not report the crime to law enforcement and to remain in contact with their attacker. In some cases, Ziv said, victims worry that their assaulter might ruin their reputation or job. Sometimes the victim maintains a relationship with the perpetrator because they have a connection to the person. ""Those women do not always leave,"" Ziv said. ""In fact, they frequently do not leave, and they stay for a long period of time, and they may think about it, but they don't do it.""","The prosecution rested its case against Weinstein on Thursday after graphic, first-person testimony from six women who said the producer had sexually assaulted them.

"American astronaut Christina Koch, who led the first all-female spacewalk in 2019, landed in Kazakhstan on Thursday after a record stay on the International Space Station, ending a 328-day mission expected to yield new insights into deep-space travel. Koch, a North Carolina-born engineer who joined Nasa's astronaut corps in 2013, set the record for the longest stay in space by a woman. Her mission will provide researchers valuable data on how weightlessness and space radiation affect the female body on long spaceflights. ""Women acclimate well to space, so I think this is a milestone that will be overtaken by women in the future and it's what we aspire to,"" said Lori Garver, Nasa's former deputy administrator. The Soyuz MS-13 capsule touched down on the snowy Kazakh Steppe at 4:12 am ET (0912 GMT) carrying Koch, 41, European astronaut Luca Parmitano of Italy and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov. They will be flown by search and recovery teams to the Karaganda region to begin their journey home. Koch also achieved a gender milestone in a spacewalk with fellow Nasa astronaut Jessica Meir last October that marked the first time two women stepped out of the space station at the same time. They completed two more all-female spacewalks in January. Nasa's first attempt at an all-female spacewalk in March 2019 was called off due to a lack of a spacesuit in the right size, which ignited a gender-equity debate. Koch's 328 days in space eclipsed Peggy Whitson's record for an American woman on a single spaceflight at 289 days. President Donald Trump congratulated Koch on her record-setting mission. Scott Kelly holds the overall American record at 340 days, and Russia's Valeri Polyakov holds the global record of 437 days aboard the defunct Mir space station. Astronauts on the space station, whose 20th anniversary in low-Earth orbit comes later this year, have made 227 maintenance spacewalks, nearly two dozen of which included women astronauts, according to Nasa. Studying the impact of lengthy spaceflights could prove useful for Nasa's aim of building a permanent space station on the moon within the next decade. Kelly's 340 days demonstrated that long-term spaceflight causes thickening of the carotid artery and retina, changes in gene expression, and slight cognitive impairment for men.","American astronaut Christina Koch, who led the first all-female spacewalk in 2019, landed in Kazakhstan on Thursday after a record stay on the International Space Station, ending a 328-day mission expected to yield new insights into deep-space travel."
"Nasa astronaut Christina Koch is going to have her mission on the International Space Station (ISS) extended to 328 days, which would set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, the US space agency said. Nasa and its ISS partners have set a new schedule and new crew assignments that will include the first flight of Nasa astronaut Jessica Meir and an extended stay for Nasa astronaut Andrew Morgan. Koch, who arrived at the space station on March 14, and now is scheduled to remain in orbit until February 2020, will eclipse the record of 288 days set by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson in 2016-17. She will be part of three expeditions - 59, 60 and 61 - during her current first spaceflight, Nasa said in a statement. ""Christina's extended mission will provide additional data for Nasa's Human Research Program and continue to support future missions to the Moon and Mars,"" said Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of the Human Research Program at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, US. Her mission is planned to be just shy of the longest single spaceflight by a Nasa astronaut - 340 days, set by former Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly during his one-year mission in 2015-16. Koch and fellow Nasa astronaut Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin will remain aboard the space station and begin Expedition 60. On July 20, Morgan, European Space Agency astronaut Luca Parmitano, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Skvortsov are scheduled to launch to the space station and join Expedition 60, returning the orbiting laboratory's crew complement to six. The extended missions of Koch and Morgan will help scientists gather additional data about the effects of long-duration human spaceflight beyond those of the normal six-month station expedition, Nasa said. Such research is essential to support future deep space exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, according to the US space agency. Nasa has gathered vast amounts of data on astronaut health and performance over the past 50 years and has focused recently on extended durations up to one year with the dedicated mission of Scott Kelly and extended mission of Peggy Whitson. These opportunities also have demonstrated that there is a significant degree of variability in human response to spaceflight and it is important to determine the acceptable degree of change for both men and women. ""Astronauts demonstrate amazing resilience and adaptability in response to long duration spaceflight exposure,"" said Fogarty. ""This will enable successful exploration missions with healthy, performance-ready astronauts. Nasa is looking to build on what we have learned with additional astronauts in space for more than 250 days,"" she said. ","Nasa astronaut Christina Koch is going to have her mission on the International Space Station (ISS) extended to 328 days, which would set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, the US space agency said."
"After breaking a spaceflight record, a NASA astronaut is preparing to head home to Galveston. Christina Koch is back on Earth after being gone for nearly 11 months. The NASA astronaut and Galveston resident took a spaceflight of 328 days, which is more time than any other American female in history. Hours after she landed, she posted on social media, saying, ""This journey has been everyone's journey. Thank you to all involved in the success of our mission, and for giving me the opportunity to carry everyone's dreams into space. I'm filled with gratitude to be back on the planet!"" Koch told ABC News that she bets her husband missed her help with housework. On Thursday, ABC13 spoke with her husband, Robert Koch. He told us about her safe trip back to Earth, ""It's exciting, for sure."" Staying in space for that long isn't easy, especially when it comes to packing for that length of time. On Thursday, teachers got an up-close look at how she did it. This happened around the same time that the Space Exploration Educators Conference was underway at Space Center Houston. More than 600 teachers, from more than 10 countries were there, including Devon Sinclair, who traveled from Minnesota. ""I never in my life thought I'd be able to do this and find out about astronauts and trips to space,"" Sinclair said. There were local teachers too, including Kelly Swanson, who teaches science at Klein ISD. ""Just the tricks that I'm learning in there and seeing what an astronaut has to pack in, that's all going straight into my classroom,"" Swanson explained. For three days, teachers will listen to speakers, and take part in different hands-on experiments. It's something Space Center Houston has offered for 26 years. Now is more crucial than ever as NASA hopes current students help them get back to the moon, and beyond. ""It's exciting for me because I was a classroom teacher for 10 years and I knew the challenges I had,"" Space Center Houston's Vice President of Education, Daniel Newmyer said. ""So, this conference is about giving teachers that support they need. They may not have it in their systems."" A real-life lesson was thrown into the classroom Thursday. Koch's historic time in space not only provided lesson plan ideas for educators, but they also believe it'll inspire young girls to dream big. ""It's really inspirational for all of my students seeing a woman in space,"" Swanson said. ""It makes you feel like, this is something I can do. She looks like me. I could do this. This could be in my future as well."" ","The extended missions of Koch and Morgan will help scientists gather additional data about the effects of long-duration human spaceflight beyond those of the normal six-month station expedition, Nasa said."
"The impressive AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X, with its unprecedented 64-core count, is already setting world records not even 24 hours after its release. The latest and all-powerful release from AMD’s Threadripper 3rd Generation line is poised to become extreme onlookers’ new favorite toy after overclockers dropped world records around it on February 7, 2020. As Tom’s Hardware reports, pro overclockers TSAIK, Allen ""Splave"" Golibersuch and safedisk showed just what the Ryzen Threadripper 3990X is capable of. By pairing the new HEDT processor with carefully handpicked hardware, all three managed to overclock its 64 cores to a whopping 5.5GHz clock speed. AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-core monster CPU is real. Ryzen Threadripper 48-core CPU could be another nail in the coffin for Intel. AMD confirms Ryzen 4000 CPUs will be out in 2020 Using liquid nitrogen (LN2), TSAIK overclocked all of the chip’s 64 cores to a 5,548.71MHz. He paired his Ryzen Threadripper 3990X with the MSI Creator TRX40 motherboard and DDR4 RAM clocked at 1,866 MHz with 13-13-13-31 CL timings. Splave, on the other hand, paired his Threadripper 3990X with the ASRock TRX40 Taichi motherboard and now holds tops the GPUPI for CPU - 1B, Geekbench 3 multi-core and Cinebench R20 benchmarks. He overclocked his chip to 5,475.43 MHz, 5,375 MHz and 5,305.88 MHz, respectively, using liquid nitrogen for at least the first two. Finally, safedisk currently holds the records for wPrime 1024m and Cinebench R15 benchmarks, clocking at 5,125 MHz and 5,225 MHz. These world records come days after benchmarks for the chip show it outperforming Intel’s Xeon Platinum 8280 processors, which are considerably more expensive at $10,009 (about £7,715, A$14,830). The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X currently retails at $3,999 (about £3,080, A$5,925). It’s available for purchase now, if you just happen to have a few extra thousand dollars lying around.","By pairing the new HEDT processor with carefully handpicked hardware, all three managed to overclock its 64 cores to a whopping 5.5GHz clock speed."
"Today, we dropped our AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X review while overclockers dropped a number of world records around the chip. A professional overclocker known as TSAIK overclocked all 64 cores to a clock speed of 5,548.71 MHz using liquid nitrogen (LN2). Careful selection of the proper hardware is key to setting world records, of course. TSAIK paired his Threadripper 3990X with MSI's Creator TRX40 motherboard and a single stick of DDR4 RAM clocked at 1,866 MHz with 13-13-13-31 CL timings. In other news, pro overclockers Allen ""Splave"" Golibersuch and safedisk also managed to snatch a couple of world records of their own with the Threadripper 3990X.

Unlike TSAIK, Splave went with the ASRock TRX40 Taichi motherboard. Meanwhile, safedisk now has the highest scores for wPrime 1024m and Cinebench R15. His Threadripper 3990X was clocked at 5,125 MHz for the first benchmark and 5,225 MHz for the latter. Given the processor's more than generous core and thread counts, the Threadripper 3990X will likely become a new favorite toy for extreme overclockers.","A professional overclocker known as TSAIK overclocked all 64 cores to a clock speed of 5,548.71 MHz using liquid nitrogen (LN2).

"The year is 2020 and today we are reviewing a new processor, a processor that reaches biblical proportions as, when it's fully utilized, it offers so much raw performance there is literally nothing comparable on the market, from any competitor. We review the all-new AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X, the behemoth of processors has actually made it to the home office and pro-consumer market at prices that will baffle Intel. This mega-core processor has 64 physical processor cores and 128 logical cores, all powered by ZEN2 architecture. This review is about to shock, awe and then some. Yes, it is rare that I feel a bit, well, nervous is not the word I am looking for, but feeling some sort of positive tension to test a product. In just three years time AMD climbed up from six, eight to twelve, sixteen, twenty-four, thirty-two... and now a processor with sixty-four processor cores. It is both shocking and baffling at the same time, the bounds forward that AMD has made are just astounding. Weirdly enough, it's becoming a little common already, I mean reviewing CPUs with 24 to even 32 processor cores. Today we again double that up and, albeit we are a consumer-oriented website and have a matching audience, AMD granted us the opportunity to review that 64-core beast. And truth be told, that is going to be a challenge, our software suite is mainly consumer-oriented; I mean finding software that can manage 16 or more cores is a challenge, let alone 64 cores and 128 threads. Obviously it is not a processor to game on (but you can), it is not a setup to 7-zip compress a few files (but you can). No, this is a processor that needs to sink its teeth into matching workloads, like a home virtual server platform, a transcode marvel, a product for video editing and streaming at the same time. The possibilities, while versatile, are of course limited. But all that doesn't matter, as the one message that AMD is relaying with the release of Threadripper 3990X is the simple fact that they can do stuff like this, no matter how small the install base is going to be. AMD unleashed their 3rd generation of Threadripper processors aka codename Castle Peak in 2019, we already reviewed the Ryzen Threadripper 3960X and 3970X, both stunning processors within their product segments and range. With the move towards the ZEN2 architecture accompanied by a chipset design, nobody was left disappointed. For many months it remained a bit of a question mark, would AMD also release new Threadripper processors, as the Ryzen 9 3950X already has 16 cores and 32 threads. Is there a point for AMD to invest in even more cores in what is a very narrow market? Well, it's AMD, of course, they would do just that for fun, kicks, and giggles to show CPU muscle. But certainly, there is also a business model at hand here, as there are SOHO companies out there that can work miracles out of 64 processor cores. The mega-core processors make relatively little sense for your avid PC gamer, these can be very compelling products to developers, content creators, and video editors. But there simply is no slowing down AMD as they are back at it with their core wars against Intel as they release the Threadripper Gen3. They started in 2019 with the 3960X & 3970X respectively holding 24 and 32 active ZEN2 processor cores. For Threadripper 3000 AMD performs gauntlet sorting of the dies, Threadripper Gen3 uses (binned) the best top 2% of dies. You know my lingo, eight is fine, sixteen is sweet and anything above that core count, spectacular.

"For once, the boys from Bangladesh were truly responsible for India's perils. At the modest Senwes Park in Potchefstroom, a university town in South Africa, Akbar Ali and his band put India's destined group in the shade to graduate as world-beaters, as the champions of ICC Under-19 World Cup.A few scores could be deducted for making a meal out of the 178-run chase and for unsportsmanlike conduct, but this, after all, was the biggest stage for cricketers yet to grow a full moustache. The bottom line is a nation that was chasing its second straight title, and fifth overall, was upstaged and Ali and Co. gave Bangladesh its first World Cup trophy — at any stage.The match started out on a different note, though. After a careful start to his innings, Yashasvi Jaiswal gradually emerged out of his cocoon following the dismissal of his opening partner, Divyaansh Saxena, taking India past 100. Quick dismissals of Tilak Varma and captain Priyam Garg, though, sent shock waves down the Indian camp, the chances of picking up the pace diminishing. And when Jaiswal fell at 88 in the 40th over, India crumbled.Bangladesh didn't make the chase easy. After a promising start, they somehow walked into a perilous state of 5 for 85. But captain Ali steadied the ship at one end, enough to take them close to the target before rain interrupted. When play resumed, the Duckworth Lewis revised target of 170 brought the coast nearer, and Bangladesh deboarded as the under-19 world champions.",Bangladesh won the cricket U-19 world cup 2020 for the first time by defeating india in the finals.

He also ensured that little Shamim, who took two wickets in that semi-final, didn't lose interest in the game when he was 12 and at a loose end.""When he was 12, a little boy, I was planning not to let Shamim do a medical test for a tournament [because he was so small, the coach didn't want the boy to play],"" Faruqi said. ""But I could see clouds gathering around his face, so I quickly told him that go ahead, do your medical. I will take you with the Under-14 squad for the experience.""It was a tournament organised by [Nurul Abedin] Nobel bhai at the Women's Complex ground in Chittagong. But when he saw Shamim, I think he was a little shocked. Nobel bhai didn't like that I had brought this kid along. I don't know if he wanted to teach me a lesson, but he made Shamim open the batting against a six-foot bowler. Shamim pulled him first ball for a four. I think we all got our answer.""Mahmudul, who last year became the highest run-getter in a calendar year in youth ODIs beating Eoin Morgan's record, is also someone Faruqi helped in his early days.

"A master of business administration (MBA) is a level up from an undergraduate business degree and generally places the graduate well above those with only undergraduate degrees. Most major universities and colleges provide MBA programs, which usually last two years. To get into an MBA program, an applicant needs to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) and be accepted by the program based on its selection criteria.MBA programs typically include core classes in accounting, management, finance, marketing, and business law. Management training is at the heart of any MBA curriculum, with a focus on leadership, planning, business strategy, organizational behavior, and the more human sides of running a large or small business. Increasingly, MBA programs are broadening their focus to include training in international business and to focus on the responsibilities and corporate accountability of businesses within their communities.The MBA degree is seen as essential to enter certain fields, including strategic planning and hedge fund and private equity firms. Other financial services fields, however, may no longer consider an MBA an entry-level degree to get started. It is not uncommon to gain professional experience before applying to elite MBA programs.While MBA candidates can focus on one of the core disciplines of the degree, such as management or finance, many MBA programs allow students to develop concentrations in specific industries. For example, an MBA student might specialize in sports management, entrepreneurship, the entertainment business, or healthcare management. Even within a management specialty, MBA degrees can allow a concentration on information technology, hospitality, education, or criminal justice. Some MBA programs team up with various professional healthcare programs, such as nursing schools, to offer joint degrees.Specialized MBA programs are also available for students whose lives and careers do not permit them to attend school full time. Executive MBA programs are designed for working professionals hoping to add to their credentials and qualifications. These courses of study typically schedule classes for nights and weekends, sometimes also requiring short residencies of intensive coursework. Executive MBA programs are typically only open to candidates who already have substantial professional experience, and they, therefore, tend to focus on more advanced topics such as leadership development.","A master of business administration (MBA) is a graduate degree that provides theoretical and practical training for business or investment management.

He also ensured that little Shamim, who took two wickets in that semi-final, didn't lose interest in the game when he was 12 and at a loose end.""When he was 12, a little boy, I was planning not to let Shamim do a medical test for a tournament [because he was so small, the coach didn't want the boy to play],"" Faruqi said. ""But I could see clouds gathering around his face, so I quickly told him that go ahead, do your medical. I will take you with the Under-14 squad for the experience.""It was a tournament organised by [Nurul Abedin] Nobel bhai at the Women's Complex ground in Chittagong. But when he saw Shamim, I think he was a little shocked. Nobel bhai didn't like that I had brought this kid along.

"Two weeks ago, I sent an e-mail from Rome, where I had been enjoying a sabbatical semester of research and writing, to a Chinese friend who lives in one of those small cities of five or six million inhabitants, very far from Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic. In my note, I said that I was sure that she was safely distant from the current crisis, but that, all the same, I was thinking of her and beaming her my warmest wishes. She replied politely that she was happy that I was having such a lovely sabbatical. As for her, however, though she was in good health, her life and the lives of everyone around her were turned topsy-turvy. The streets in her city were empty; places of work were all closed; she and her family were confined at home; one of them per day might receive permission to go out, masked, to shop for food and supplies; everyone lived in fear. I was suitably embarrassed by my e-mail’s ridiculous insouciance, but at the time I did not fully grasp the extent of my stupidity.I get it now, thanks to the unfolding events in Italy. The initial reports of an outbreak, in a few towns in the north of the country, were alarming enough, but it remained news coming from far away. With astonishing rapidity, the situation worsened: in quick succession, whole communities were quarantined; schools and churches closed their doors; museums, galleries, and palaces were shuttered; concerts were cancelled. If anyone hadn’t already taken in the gravity of the situation, two further occurrences made it overwhelmingly apparent: parts of Milan Fashion Week, the crown jewel of one of Italy’s greatest economic successes, were closed to the public, and, still more ominously, the soccer game between Inter Milan and a rival was played before an eerily empty stadium. As any Italian knows, soccer, far more than religion, is sacred; denying fans access to the match was an even more drastic signal than temporarily closing Milan Cathedral to tourists and the faithful.In Rome, the virus had not yet surfaced, and there were very few signs of alarm, apart from a run on hand sanitizer. But, as the constant reports in the newspapers and on television accumulated, the mood altered. The news from the north, we began to say to one another, resembled the thud of artillery shells exploding in a battle somewhere across the mountains, out of sight but no longer so far distant as to be inaudible. And then steadily the enemy moved across Lombardy and Veneto and south into Tuscany and Umbria. Where were our defenders? If we were to continue the military metaphor, we had to concede that Venice was gravely threatened, then Bergamo, then Florence. Rome would fall soon.","The initial reports of an outbreak, in a few towns in the north of the country, were alarming enough, but it remained news coming from far away. "
"Aggressive measures work.New cases have dropped to 200 a day from over 3,000 a day one month ago. After the initial chaos and cover-up in Wuhan, health authorities imposed a lockdown, strict quarantines, mandatory testing and isolation. That prevented what would have been hundreds of thousands of infections.There aren’t many asymptomatic cases.Testing of 320,000 samples suggests that the known cases are not just the tip of an iceberg. “What we’re seeing is a pyramid: Most of it is above ground,” Dr. Aylward said.Be prepared to move medical care online …To keep the sick and the healthy from mingling in clinics and emergency rooms, online medical consultations and prescriptions became the norm.

To protect families, the infected were taken to isolation centers; the seriously ill and elderly went to hospitals.Having to pay may slow containment.Testing was free in China, as was all care for hospitalized patients. If Americans delay getting tested for fear of the medical bills “that’s what could wreak havoc,” Dr. Aylward said. “The U.S. has to think this through.”","Aggressive measures work.There aren’t many asymptomatic cases.Be prepared to move medical care online, as well as other services.Having to pay may slow containment.Civic spirit can make a difference."
"They call it the “Blue Great Wall.”The cobalt-hued metal sheets sprang up just weeks ago across Tianjin, a port city of over 15 million people in northeastern China.

"In January, the Coral Princess, a ship with 2,000 berths and a crew of nearly 900, plowed through the frigid waters off the Antarctic Peninsula, cruising past icebergs, glaciers and mountains clad in snow. The cruise, which had been advertised at less than $4,000 per person, is remarkably cheaper than most Antarctic expeditions, which often charge guests at least three times that amount for the privilege of visiting one of the wildest parts of the planet. Visitors to the region — and the ships that carry them — are growing in number: Antarctica, once accessible only to well-funded explorers, is now edging toward the mainstream.But managing tourism is a tricky issue in this distant region where no individual government has the power to set the rules, and the challenge is becoming more complex as Antarctica’s popularity grows. During the current austral summer, which runs from roughly November to March, visitor numbers to Antarctica are expected to rise by nearly 40 percent from the previous season. Some observers warn that such rapid growth risks imperiling visitor safety and adding pressure to this fragile region, which is already straining under the effects of climate change, commercial fishing for krill, toothfish and other species, and even scientific research.Human activity in Antarctica falls under the governance of the Antarctic Treaty system, a model of international cooperation that dates to the Cold War era. But day-to-day management of tourism is regulated by the tour operators themselves, through a voluntary trade association that sets and enforces rules among its members. Observers agree that this system has worked well since it was set up in the 1990s, but some worry that booming tourist numbers could push the old system to a breaking point. They say that the consultative parties to the Antarctic Treaty system — governments like those of the United States, France, New Zealand, Argentina and some two dozen others — must act more quickly to manage tourism, and protect the region’s value as a wilderness.“The bottom line for us is that there aren’t a lot of hard rules governing tourism. It’s mostly voluntary,” said Claire Christian, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC), a network of more than 15 conservation groups that serves as an observer to the Antarctic Treaty system. “Right now, there is a lot of good will. But that’s not something you can guarantee.”","In January, the Coral Princess, a ship with 2,000 berths and a crew of nearly 900, plowed through the frigid waters off the Antarctic Peninsula, cruising past icebergs, glaciers and mountains clad in snow.

"Representatives from Brazil’s scientific community and government will head to Antarctica this month to inaugurate its new Comandante Ferraz Research Station, which replaces a facility lost to fire in 2012. The two low-slung buildings, designed by Estudio 41, a Brazilian architecture firm, house laboratories, operational support and living quarters — and could be mistaken for an art museum or a boutique hotel.“Brazil is a tropical country, so we were not used to these conditions,” said Emerson Vidigal, a principal at the firm.“These conditions” include temperatures that drop below minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit and winds that reach 100 miles per hour.Throughout the 20th century, architecture in Antarctica was a pragmatic and largely makeshift affair, focused on keeping the elements out and the occupants alive. In 1959, the Antarctic Treaty dedicated the continent to research. Since then scientists have come in growing numbers and with ever more complex needs. Construction in Antarctica, long the purview of engineers, is now attracting designer architects looking to bring aesthetics — as well as operational efficiency, durability and energy improvements — to the coldest neighborhood on Earth.Continue reading the main story“As architects, we are concerned with human comfort, so we set out to create a kind of atmosphere that would promote well-being,” Mr. Vidigal said.When British explorers built one of the first permanent structures there, in 1902, they insulated it with felt and clad it in wood. The hut was “so draughty and cold in comparison with the ship,” Ernest Shackleton, one of the crew members on that expedition, recalled, “that it was, during the first year, never used for living quarters.” As accumulating snow rendered the door impassable, the crew resorted to using a window to come and go.","Throughout the 20th century, architecture in Antarctica was a pragmatic and largely makeshift affair, focused on keeping the elements out and the occupants alive.When British explorers built one of the first permanent structures there, in 1902, they insulated it with felt and clad it in wood."

"in May 2008, Iron Man introduced rich jerk Tony Stark to the public — and changed the entire superhero industry in the process.Iron Man inducted Stark as the first official member of the Avengers. The movie was a flash of brash brilliance, and one that was lauded for having crossover appeal outside the usual comic-fan audience. But the most consequential part of the film may be a seemingly minor aside uttered by Nick Fury to Stark in the post-credits scene.You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet. [Nick Fury, Iron Man]Stark did indeed become part of a bigger universe. And that has been revolutionary for entertainment — not just for fans, but for the business.Today, the Marvel Cinematic Universe — the MCU — is one of pop culture's most dominant entities. Since Iron Man's premiere, Disney and Marvel Studios have raked in a worldwide gross well over $13 billion across 19 movies. Meanwhile, Iron Man co-stars in Spider-Man's movie. Black Panther is introduced in Captain America's film. And they all get together to save the world in the Avengers flicks. Superheroes are everywhere; superheroes are everything. And the borders between their films are all but nonexistent.Marvel had always intended to team Iron Man with The Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Captain America. Together they would ward off inconceivable planetary dangers, and eventually team up with even more heroes, like Scarlet Witch, the Vision, and Black Panther. This plan obviously worked exceptionally well.Like all blockbusters, the profitable superhero movies still got sequels a decade ago. What they didn't get were cousin films and nominal standalone productions linked through inter-universe references, cameo appearances, and storylines bleeding over from different films. The superhero film — in defiance of its parent medium, the comic — used to be self-contained. Read a comic book or two and you'll find heroes crossing over from the pages of their own properties to others, but in 2008 this was a convention standard on the page but foreign on the screen.Nobody really thought to try that with movies — not until Iron Man set the MCU's wheels in motion. Back in 2008, the post-credits tease in Iron Man felt audacious. Superheroes were compartmentalized. They abided the frames of the movies built around them; they didn't set foot onto other stages, trade banter, fight the same villains, or beef with each other. Iron Man promised something different and totally unheard of — and with last week's release of Avengers: Infinity War, the Marvel enterprise has come full circle.Not only that, but for a movie about a billionaire playboy genius who builds a suit of powered armor to escape from terrorists — and later, to satisfy his newfound need to bring justice to a troubled world — Iron Man has a surprisingly intimate scope. There are no civil wars fought, no city takeovers and hostage threats, no galactic beings intent on destroying the planet. There is only a moneyed megalomaniac who gets shocked into becoming a better person after confronting the ugly consequences of his arms manufacturing business face to face.Granted, yes, there is that slugfest between Stark and his business partner, Obadiah Stane, both of them clad in Iron Man armor. But in a universe that's come to include a pantheon of gods, sorcery, and green-skinned rage monsters, powered armor feels pretty down to earth. After all, beneath it, there's only a man.That's another thing that makes Tony Stark, and Iron Man, essential to the post-2010s superhero boom. Stark isn't quite relatable, per se — few among us can truly relate to a guy with bottomless resources and Robert Downey Jr.'s good looks — but he is, at the core, a human on the quest for humility. Stark is the template for a number of characters brought to screens large and small since Iron Man's release 10 years ago, from The Green Hornet's Britt Reid to Arrow's Oliver Queen in the DC universe, to even the MCU's Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, whose arc in the 2016 movie Doctor Strange bears a striking resemblance to Stark's in Iron Man: arrogant man of wealth goes through a traumatic experience that humbles him and pushes him to abandon his old life to pursue higher aspirations.After Iron Man, projects centered on swaggering ladykillers with too much money became their own sub-niche in the superhero genre, from the aforementioned The Green Hornet and Arrow to The Green Lantern, whose hero Hal Jordan makes up in cockiness what he lacks in funds.That's not to say Iron Man invented the modern superhero. But it did invent the modern superhero movie as we know it. Taken together, the film was a watershed: It opened the door to a new kind of superhero, and spawned a collection of interconnected films for those heroes to appear in.So it turns out Tony Stark has a superpower after all: He can bring together heroes from across nations and even galaxies, by doing nothing more than rejecting his industrialist ways.","Iron Man inducted Stark as the first official member of the Avengers.

"A couple of things make Iron Man different to your regular comic-book superhero movie.First, there is the hero himself, Tony Stark, a scientific genius who for once is not the timid or bespectacled geek we are used to in Hollywood, but is charismatic, confident, and a hit with the ladies.Stark is played by Robert Downey Jr, and we think he deserves to go in any list of the top 10 coolest fictional scientists. But it is the technology that Stark uses to turn himself into Iron Man that gets us going. The tech in the movie is probably more firmly rooted in reality than you might think – unless, that is, you are a regular New Scientist reader.We have spotted at least five classes of tech in the movie that we have written about before. So, for those keen to find more about the real science behind the fictional Iron Man,Superhero skin Stark is a brilliant engineer who has made billions from building weapons. Kidnapped in Afghanistan, he questions his life, and resolves to put his genius to better use: to protecting rather than destroying. To that end, he builds himself a suit of armour that gives him superhuman powers. Watch a short excerpt from the film showing the suit’s capabilitiesNo such suit exists – yet. The leg sections of a wearable exoskeleton have been built, however.This contraption does not yet give the wearer added strength, but it does make the backpack they are carrying feel lighter, by transferring its weight to the ground. This can makes a 36-kilogram (79-pound) load feel about 80% lighter. Other teams are building similar suits, and a Japanese company plans to sell one later this year.Flying machines Of course, the coolest thing about Stark’s suit is not its strength but its ability to fly. In the film, Stark zooms to Afghanistan, just in the nick of time to stop warlords killing a group of poor villagers.It couldn’t reach Afghanistan, perhaps, but SoloTrek was a flying exoskeleton that was apparently capable of travelling more than 200 kilometres. (The project shut down after a crash in 2002.)Danger and possible financial ruin hasn’t put everyone off. UK inventor and pilot Stuart Ross reckons his Rocketbelt packs enough power to lift him 2500 metres in the air and plans to test fly the latest model this year.Friendly botsIn the movie, Stark has a friendly robot to help him build his armour. It looks too clever to be true, but in fact it is highly reminiscent of AUR. Built last year by MIT scientists, AUR is a robotic desk lamp that calculates where you are looking and moves its flexible neck to shine light on that spot.And while Stark’s robotic helper doesn’t always correctly guess what he wants, as real-world software grows evermore sophisticated, it too is making the same mistakes humans doIn the great tradition of robots in movies, Stark forms emotional bonds with his. At one point, his assistant Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) catches him in what looks like a compromising position with his robots (“Let’s face it, this isn’t the worst thing you’ve walked in on me doing,” says Stark).Will humans and robots ever have relationships like this? It’s certainly something NASA is trying to figure out. Should robots be better tools or better teammates?Owners of the robotic vacuum cleaner Roomba seem to think the latter, treating the machine more like part of the family than a tool.Cunning computingMoving from robots to software, when Pepper sees a video clip sent by terrorists who have captured Stark, she uses nifty real-time translation program to understand their demands.The most fashionable way for software right now to learn how to translate is for it to scan through thousands of previously translated documents. But the approach doesn’t always work, with sometimes unfortunate results.This is just some of the tech used in Iron Man that is rooted in reality. Others include a 3D tactile interface that Stark uses to design his armour, targeting software that homes in on human heads, and the problem of ice formation when flying.","First, there is the hero himself, Tony Stark, a scientific genius who for once is not the timid or bespectacled geek we are used to in Hollywood, but is charismatic, confident, and a hit with the ladies.This is just some of the tech used in Iron Man that is rooted in reality.

"Iam Iron Man.” Four words that changed the superhero film genre for good. With 2008’s Iron Man, director Jon Favreau and Marvel Studios gave audiences something they’d rarely seen before on the big screen: a superhero who doesn’t hide their identity. For decades, the superhero was a caped silhouette, standing tall, god-like. But in recent years the Marvel Cinematic Universe has offered characters that both complement and complicate that image.Iron Man, aka Tony Stark, made his solo comic book outing in 1968’s ‘The Invincible Iron Man’. In contrast to the character depicted in this series, the films show a complex, multi-faceted Stark who is anything but invincible. At a time when mental health is being discussed more openly than ever before, with one in six young people likely to experience anxiety and depression at some point in life, imperfect heroes couldn’t have come at a better time.In Favreau’s Iron Man, after inheriting Stark Industries from his late father, our hero is brought face to face with the horrifying global impact of his company’s work. When he is kidnapped and forced to build a devastating weapon, he is made to see the realities of how he made his living. It was while being held hostage that he designed his first Iron Man suit as a means of escape.Stark’s anxiety manifests itself as a need to be in complete control. He laments to Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Iron Man 3, “You experience things, and then they’re over, and you still can’t explain them.” As an engineer, he breaks practical problems down into smaller ones that he can solve piece by piece. It’s much harder to do that with his mind. Stark can’t process a problem he can’t fix with a few metal pieces or wires, and he runs from this realisation his whole life.In Iron Man 3, Stark has his first anxiety attack. The film directly follows the events of The Avengers, during which Stark flies into a wormhole in New York City to destroy it with a missile. As he enters the wormhole, J.A.R.V.I.S. suggests that he call Pepper; Stark knows what this means and is fully prepared to say goodbye.This experience plagues him throughout the subsequent films. He feels completely unprepared, believing that if he faces a threat on that scale again he will let everyone down. Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) informs Stark of a recent bombing but, as he does so, the background noise around Stark begins to build up, triggering flashbacks to the attack on New York. He bolts out of the café and, out of breath, steps into his suit just as his knees buckle under him. Frantically, Stark asks J.A.R.V.I.S, “Check my heart. Is it the brain? Was I poisoned?” When he’s told that he suffered a severe anxiety attack, Stark is in disbelief: “Me?”Stark’s persistent denial that a person such as himself could deal with any form of mental illness speaks to his desire to fix everything. Instead of sleeping or spending time with Pepper, he devotes himself entirely to building new suits, new weapons, new lines of defence. Back in the café, when Rhodes expresses his concern, Stark retorts, “Einstein slept three hours a year, look what he did.” While those closest to him think he has built 10 or 15 suits in total, in his basement Tony is working on a Mark 42. He’s no longer just anxious – he’s obsessive.In Age of Ultron, when Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) shows Tony his darkest fears, he sees the Avengers dead before his feet – and it’s his fault. In Captain America: Civil War, when brought face to face with the destruction he and his team always leaves behind, Stark can’t live with the guilt and so he signs the Sokovia Accords, a piece of legislation requiring all superheroes to reveal their secret identities and disclose their powers. Stark constantly fears the day he lets down those he loves, and he deals with it by retreating from them to build them as much protection as he can.Of course, one rich white man’s battle with mental illness isn’t going to resonate with everyone. But it’s important that Stark is not portrayed as a wholly good individual: he can be selfish, arrogant, an egomaniac. Sometimes, he’s even framed as an antagonist. The villainous Ultron is literally the product of Stark’s ego; blinded by progress he builds a sentient weapon that nearly kills millions and results directly in the drafting of the Sokovia Accords. You could go as far as calling Tony Stark an anti-hero – that is what makes him such a compelling character. No matter how privileged a person is, they can still be affected by anxiety, depression and other forms of mental illness.Tony Stark is an authentic and complicated hero, someone who can seemingly build anything and is willing to stand up to the world’s greatest evils – often alone – but who is still vulnerable, compulsive and obsessive, and who deals with the same inner demons we all must face. His arc has continuously evolved during the decade-long expansion of the MCU; perhaps now he is finally coming to terms with the fact that he can’t save everyone. This sentiment echoes his own words way back in the Avengers. “If we can’t protect the world, you can be damn well sure we’ll avenge it.”","Iron Man, aka Tony Stark, made his solo comic book outing in 1968’s ‘The Invincible Iron Man’.

"Simon and Kirby created Steve Rogers, a would-be army enlistee rejected by recruiters because of his small size. Rogers volunteers to receive a top-secret serum, and he is transformed into a “super soldier.” Dubbed Captain America and clad in a red, white, and blue costume with a matching stars-and-stripes shield, Rogers joins the U.S. Army, acquires a kid sidekick—plucky regimental mascot Bucky Barnes—and embarks on a career of enthusiastic Nazi-bashing.The early stories were simple, straightforward tales peopled with bizarre villains such as the Hunchback of Hollywood, the Black Toad, and Ivan the Terrible. Chief among them was the Red Skull, a seemingly invincible Nazi whose face literally was a crimson skull. The stories of derring-do were gripping and fast-moving, and the comic became one of the most widely read titles of the so-called Golden Age of comics. Audience identification with Captain America was central to that success. The first issue announced the creation of “The Sentinels of Liberty” fan club; eager young readers could join for just a dime, which entitled them to a membership card and a metal badge. The club proved so popular that its badge promotion had to be discontinued because of wartime metal rationing.By the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, Captain America Comics had become the publisher’s top-selling title, and, over the course of World War II, Captain America and Bucky fought the Axis powers on multiple fronts. After 10 successful issues, the comic’s creators were enticed away to rival company DC Comics, but their replacements—novice writer-editor Stan Lee and various artists—handled things well. In 1944 the character received the honour of his own Republic Pictures serial, Captain America, which was confirmation of his iconic status. As the war wound down, the market for patriotic superheroes began to shrink, and Captain America and Bucky were literally put on ice. In a story set in the final days of the war, the pair attempt to defuse a bomb on a drone aircraft, but the plane explodes over the frigid North Atlantic, sparking a complicated chain of events that ends with Bucky missing and Rogers floating in the water, seemingly dead.The postwar years saw a proliferation of differently themed comics: horror, funny animals, westerns, romance stories—everything, it seemed, except superheroes. With the disappearance of Rogers, the mantle of Captain America passed to a succession of replacement heroes, but they failed to resonate with the stalwart Sentinels of Liberty club members. Captain America Comics ended with issue no. 73 (July 1949), and, after two issues titled Captain America’s Weird Tales, the series was canceled. Barely four years later, however, Captain America returned in Young Men no. 24 (1953), and the Captain America comic resumed printing in May 1954. The book, which boasted Captain America…Commie Smasher! as a subtitle, was an obvious product of the McCarthy era. The public did not warm to it. The Captain America series was canceled for a second time in September 1954.","Simon and Kirby created Steve Rogers, a would-be army enlistee rejected by recruiters because of his small size.

"The Captain America movies—like most Marvel movies—are a lot of fun, but they rarely leave anything open to interpretation. These are not movies that cut to credits with Hawkeye's arrow spinning on a table, Inception-style, making you wonder if the Ed Norton Incredible Hulk film was a dream or not. Captain America: Civil War would seem to be no exception. At the end of that movie, the new status quo is very clear: The Avengers are split down the middle, and everyone on Captain America's team is now in hiding, officially fugitives from the law. However, the Russo brothers—who directed Civil War and are responsible for shepherding the Marvel Cinematic Universe right on through the two-part Avengers finale—suggest that maybe we should've read into a scene a bit more.In an interview with The Huffington Post, the directors state that, toward the film's end, when Captain America drops his shield at a crucial moment, the implication is that he's done being Captain America.""I think him dropping that shield is him letting go of that identity,” Joe Russo told the Post. “[It’s] him admitting that certainly the identity of Captain America was in conflict with the very personal choice that he was making.”Of course, the filmmakers acknowledge that Captain America will eventually show up again to help in the fight against the ultimate threat posed by the Marvel long game represented by Thanos and the Infinity Stones, but that's a few years out. What will Steve Rogers be in the meantime, if not Captain America? Odds are, probably nothing—the ending of Civil War is a nice way of taking the character off the board and letting him cook for a bit before trotting him out for the grand finale of Avengers: Infinity War. But there are other options: In the comics, Steve Rogers has at times taken on other identities when he no longer felt the title of Captain America suited his mission, like the stretch of comics in the '70s when he took on the name Nomad, for example. Or, it could also be the opportunity for someone else to try on the Stars and Stripes. Like The Falcon, or Bucky—both things that have also happened in the comic books.This is all just a natural part of the superhero life cycle. All heroes, if they stick around long enough, have one of the following happen to them:They'll die (and then un-die).They'll quit (and then un-quit).They'll have some aspect of their personal histories wiped away from existence by some sort of grand cosmic or metaphysical threat best left unquestioned (hrmmmghhhhhuuughhhhh).If you want an idea of how common these events are, Spider-Man has done all three, more than once.For now, though, it seems like Steve Rogers is merely one of us. A civilian; an anonymous face in the crowd, checking Twitter, sharing memes, and waiting for Black Panther to drop.","In an interview with The Huffington Post, the directors state that, toward the film's end, when Captain America drops his shield at a crucial moment, the implication is that he's done being Captain America."
"It looks like Captain America is a supervillain now. You probably found out about it on Facebook. More specifically, a comic called Steve Rogers: Captain America #1 by writer Nick Spencer and artist Jesus Saiz revealed that Steve Rogers, the comic book character Chris Evans has been playing on movie screens for five years now, is secretly a Hydra deep cover agent. In short: The comic implies that Captain America is, and always was, a villain.This is, to say the least, controversial. There's also a lot to unpack beyond the blaring headline (as there always is). So let's walk through this step-by-step, just so you know how to deal in the event that you, say, come across a particularly angry Facebook post about how comics are ruining Captain America AGAIN.First, there are two things we all need to understand about monthly superhero comics: 1.) They are serial stories that generally unfold five to six issues at a time, largely subsisting on cliffhangers. And 2.) Despite their popularity in movie theaters, actual monthly comics are not big business. So if a comic book publisher crafts a juicy cliffhanger about a well-known character that could conceivably drive people in large numbers to check out a comic, you bet your ass they're going to shout it from the rooftops.Next, what the hell is Hydra, even? Aren't they Nazis? Yes—kind of. In the comics, Hydra started out as a nebulously evil group, but eventually solidified to be more or less descended from the remnants of Nazi Germany. Captain America: The First Avenger depicts Hydra as the Nazi science division, a sort of evil R&D team. They go rogue, becoming more or less too extreme for even Hitler, and turn into a network of sleeper cells that effectively infiltrate the world government.And in the current Captain America comics, Steve Rogers has not been Captain America since fall of 2014, when sci-fi comic book shenanigans turned him into an old man. In the time since, the title of Captain America has passed to Sam Wilson, the hero formerly known as The Falcon (Anthony Mackie in the movies). However, more recent sci-fi comic book shenanigans have restored Steve Rogers' youth and vigor once more, making him available to take his old job back. This would have been a bad look—the old, white hero takes his title back from the new, black one—and Marvel announced that instead, they would compromise, letting them both be Captain America and giving them each their own comic book series. (Which is still, as we argued, a bad look.)Captain America, a character created by the very Jewish Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, seemingly a Nazi-like double agent.This is also a white Captain America, returning alongside a black one who has taken his place for over a year.. in a comic book, a medium with a historic propensity for doing outrageous things in order to get fans talking.It's easy to say, ""Well, the story obviously isn't finished yet, let's wait and see where they're going."" And yes, that is reasonable.But the optics of this twist shift depending on what stance you come at it from. If you take the point of view of a Jewish reader, for example, it's easy: This shit's messed up. But. To that second point: Take that white guy and imply that in this context he's a villain—well, that's an interesting way of sidestepping the separate-but-equal-Captain-Americas problem, and it's almost downright clever. Its author is unquestionably Marvel's most political writer; his stories are often comedic satires dressed up as superhero stories. (His first story about Sam Wilson as Captain America, for example, was titled Not My Captain America.) While his stuff doesn't always land, this is very much in his wheelhouse, as complicated and messy as it all is.Regardless, Marvel wins. We're all talking about their damn comic.","It looks like Captain America is a supervillain now. In the time since, the title of Captain America has passed to Sam Wilson, the hero formerly known as The Falcon (Anthony Mackie in the movies)."
"Thor’s first adventure introduced readers to the doctor Donald Blake. While vacationing in Norway, Blake stumbles across an invasion force of the Stone Men of Saturn (an alien race later known as Kronans). When the startled doctor takes refuge in a nearby cave, he finds a cane, which he strikes against the wall, only to find himself dramatically changed. Blake becomes the thunder god Thor, and the cane transforms into the enchanted hammer Mjolnir. The inscription on the hammer declares, “Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.” As Thor, Blake could fly and control the elements, and he possessed extraordinary strength. Mjolnir magically returned after being thrown, but if it was out of Thor’s grasp for more than one minute, Thor reverted to his civilian identity as Blake.Neither Lee nor Kirby was consistently able to fit the Thor comic strip into their schedules for its first few years, so Lee’s brother, Larry Lieber, scripted much of the early material. After several issues, Kirby moved on to the new X-Men and Avengers titles but not before contributing to Thor’s supporting cast. Having returned to New York, Blake set up a practice with a young nurse named Jane Foster, with whom he promptly fell in love. She long remained unaware of Blake’s alter ego, however, as revealing that knowledge was strictly forbidden by Thor’s father, Odin, the ruler of the Norse gods in the distant realm of Asgard. Thor’s villainous half-brother Loki, the god of mischief, served as the strip’s most prominent recurring villain.Thor soon accumulated a stable of more mundane foes, such as the Grey Gargoyle, Radioactive Man, the Cobra, and Mister Hyde. Thor became a founding member of the Avengers in 1963, but his solo series in Journey into Mystery began to evolve as Lee and Kirby returned in late 1963 to change the strip’s focus from Earth-bound crime-fighting to the more expansive, imaginative realm of Asgard. The creative team introduced a new series, “Tales of Asgard,” which adapted Norse legends and integrated them with the lead strip’s growing band of Asgardians. Among the most important new characters were Thor’s companions Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun—a band collectively known as the Warriors Three—and his half-brother Balder. Other supporting characters included Heimdall, guardian of the Rainbow Bridge to Asgard, and Sif, a shield maiden who was one of Asgard’s most skilled fighters. Among the Asgardian antagonists introduced during this period were the sorceress Karnilla, Amora the Enchantress, and the axe-wielding Skurge the Executioner.Norse legends had fascinated Kirby since childhood, and, coupled with his almost boundless imagination, they inspired some of his greatest art: astonishing battle scenes, vast cosmic vistas, and extraordinary creatures. After issue no. 125 (February 1966), Journey into Mystery was retitled Thor, and a stream of new heroes and villains appeared. A lengthy narrative introduced the Greek god Hercules, his father Zeus, and the ruler of the Netherworld, Pluto. Later stories featured the grotesque rock troll Ulik; Hela, the goddess of death; and the fire demon Surtur, all of whom conspired against Asgard. Amid all the rest, of course, there were regular plots and schemes by Loki.","Thor, American comic strip superhero created for Marvel Comics by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. The character, derived from the Germanic god of the same name, first appeared in Journey into Mystery no. 83 (August 1962)."
"Thor (Old Norse: Þórr) is the Norse god of thunder, the sky, and agriculture. He is the son of Odin, chief of the gods, and Odin's consort Jord (Earth) and husband of the fertility goddess Sif, who is the mother of his son Modi and daughter Thrud; his other son, Magni, may be the offspring of a union with the giantess Jarnsaxa. Thor was the defender of Asgard, realm of the gods, and Midgard, the human realm, and is primarily associated with protection through great feats of arms in slaying giants.The majority of the tales featuring Thor, in fact, put him in conflict with a giant or with his nemesis the Midgard Serpent (Jörmungandr, the “huge monster”), a monstrous snake who coils and twists itself around the world. Like almost all of the Norse gods, Thor is doomed to die at Ragnarök, the end of the world and twilight of the gods, but falls only after killing the great serpent with his powerful hammer Mjollnir, dying to its poison; his sons Magni and Modi survive Ragnarök along with a small number of other gods and inherit his hammer which they use to restore order.He developed from the earlier Germanic god Donar and became the most popular deity of the Norse pantheon. Thor continues as a popular god in the present day, too, and the modern English and German words for the fifth day of the week – Thursday and Donnerstag – both allude to Thor/Donar (“Thor’s Day”/“Donar’s Day”). He was thought to have ruled the sky from his land of Þrúðvangr (“Power-Field” or “Plains of Strength”) where he built his great hall of Bilskírnir, a palace of 540 rooms.Thor functioned primarily as a protector-god, although stories concerning him also explained natural phenomena, thus linking him with the etiological type of myth (one which explains how some aspect of life came to be). He was said to burst forth from his great hall in his chariot, drawn by two male goats – Tanngnjóstr (Tooth Gnasher) and Tanngrísnir (Snarl Tooth) – who could be killed and eaten by the god and then brought back to life the next day as long as their bones remained unbroken. The roar of thunder was the rumble of Thor’s chariot’s wheels across the vault of the heavens and, in another story, he is credited with creating tides.For the most part, however, he was invoked for protection and problem-solving. Scholar Preben Meulengracht Sørensen comments that Thor “was master of thunder and lightning, storm and rain, fair weather and crops, and the pagans sacrificed to him when threatened by hunger or disease” (Sawyer, 203). He had three magical items which helped him defend Asgard and Midgard: his hammer Mjollnir, his belt of strength Megingjörð (which doubled his strength when he wore it), and his great iron gloves which he needed to wield his hammer.","Thor (Old Norse: Þórr) is the Norse god of thunder, the sky, and agriculture.

"Unsure who Black Widow is? Having trouble deciphering the Hulk’s roar? Can’t tell the difference between Hawkeye and Katniss? In anticipation of the release of The Avengers on May 4, EW’s team of super geeks is here to help guide you through the mythos with our seven-part series of superhero primers, the recently declassified “Avengers Files.” It doesn’t matter if you’re a comic book connoisseur or a Nick Fury newbie — follow along this week as we deconstruct Earth’s mightiest heroes and pose the question: Which Avenger is the mightiest?Name: Thor, God of ThunderFirst comic appearance: Journey into Mystery #83 (August 10, 1962), created by Stan Lee, written by Larry Lieber, and pencilled by Jack Kirby.First movie appearance: Thor (2011); $181 million domestic, $449.3 million worldwidePortrayed by: Thor was voiced by Chris Wiggins in thirteen episodes of the barely-animated late-’60s anthology The Marvel Superheroes. (Alas, Thor’s minstrel-chorus ballad theme song was decidedly less memorable than Captain America’s.) The character appeared in the flesh in the telefilm The Incredible Hulk Returns, where he was played by Eric Allan Kramer in a Viking Quest costume. Animation enthusiasts might remember that John Rhys-Davis voiced Thor on a few episodes of various ’90s Marvel cartoons, but it’s fair to say that Chris Hemsworth’s big-screen role as the Thunder God is the definitive incarnation of the character for the vast, vast majority of the public.Origin story: Thor is one of the great problematic characters in comic book history. Compared to the other iconic Avengers, his back story is much more openly fantastical — or ludicrous, depending on your perspective. Captain America, Iron Man, and the Hulk all emerged from a particular school of mid-century science-fiction: They’re all normal men made extraordinary by modern science, by super-drugs and advanced technology and weapons of mass destruction. (If you think about it, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are both mad scientists, really.) Thor comes from a much earlier narrative tradition: He’s the Norse God of Thunder. He was a religious figure back in the days when the Roman Empire was a thing. He’s the guy Thursday is named after. And he has a big hammer that throws thunderbolts.The character’s history gets even more problematic when you consider that his very first appearance is an awkward, fascinating, dream-logic narrative that barely hints at the character’s future trajectory. In Journey into Mystery #83, disabled doctor Donald Blake goes on vacation to Norway and runs afoul of an invading party of stone men from Saturn. Blake flees into a cave, finds a walking stick, strikes it against a rock… and is suddenly transformed into Thor, the God of Thunder. It’s all very wonderfully weird — not least because the stone-men apparently traveled all the way to Norway — and early issues of Thor basically follow the same Jekyll/Hyde structure: Donald Blake gets into a scrap and turns into his godlike alter ego to solve the problem.The character’s background quickly evolved, gathering mythic dimensions, and later retconning revealed that Odin — King of Asgard and Thor’s father — felt the need to teach his arrogant son a lesson about humility, and had actually imprisoned Thor in the body of Donald Blake. That central notion — that Thor is an egotistical warrior with something to learn from humanity — has defined the character ever since.Weapon/Superpower: Thor has super-strength and is practically invulnerable. He can also control the weather. If all that isn’t enough, he carries a hammer so powerful it has to have a name: Mjolnir, pronounced “Me-Ole-Near.” The hammer can fire pure thunder energy, but Thor mostly uses it in a more tactile way: By throwing it at people. (Thor can even fly, although only by throwing the hammer into the air and holding on for dear life.)","Thor is one of the great problematic characters in comic book history.

"As the coronavirus spreads in Japan, and rapidly through the world, concerns have arisen about whether the Olympics, set to open on 24 July, can proceed at all and what fallback plans Japan has for postponement or cancellation.Officials in Japan and at the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have sought to reassure the public that the Games will go ahead as scheduled, despite the epidemic, but the Mainichi said there are event-specific plans for natural disasters that regularly strike the island nation.Under the plans, competitions would be cancelled if the venues were hit by a quake measuring an upper-6 or 7 on Japan’s intensity index, which runs to 7, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources involved in the organising committee.Unlike a magnitude reading, which measures the inherent strength of a quake, intensity measures the amount of shaking felt at a given place.Japan often experiences earthquakes, but an upper-6 is one where it is impossible to stand, windows are likely to break and most unreinforced concrete-block walls collapse.In addition, the Mainichi said, the plans call for halting events if the authorities issue a 4 or higher on Japan’s 5-point disaster-warning system for a typhoon or other disaster.The Tokyo 2020 press office did not respond to a request for comment.A powerful typhoon forced the cancellation of three matches in last year’s Rugby World Cup.","As the coronavirus spreads, concerns have arisen about whether the Olympics can proceed at all and what fallback plans Japan has for postponement or cancellation.Officials in Japan and at the International Olympic Committee have sought to reassure the public that the Games will go ahead as scheduled, despite the epidemic"

"England Women made it to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup. That was expected. What most pundits did not predict, however, was that they would finish second in the group. Even that should not have bothered them too much, for in a way it was an encore of the previous edition, when they, just like this time, had finished second and met India in the semi-final. They had won that day, so why fear?Unfortunately, they had not accounted for the weather. According to the playing conditions, in case of abandoned matches in the knockout stage, the topper of a group (India in this case) would go through to the final. In other words, there was little England could have done since their defeat against South Africa in the tournament opener.Had England won that match, they would have topped the group, avoided an elimination due to rain, and faced Australia in the second semi-final. If that was washed out, England would have gone through. As things turned out, since their first match, England’s survival in the tournament depended entirely on South Africa’s performances and weather.While Indian fans have reasons to celebrate the outcome – after all, this is going to be their first final in the history of the tournament – this is not the way they would have wanted to qualify.Of course, one cannot blame ICC for their faith in the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) ground staff and drainage system – they had ensured play during the Big Bash League (BBL) final against all odds – but even they cannot do anything if the rain does not stop at all.That ICC did not arrange for reserve days in case of washouts was known well in advance. However, as is often the case, the problem with the rules came into forefront only when it was actually implemented, not before the tournament.","ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2020: Time for organisers to do something about rain rules for knockout matchesThe first semi-final, between India and England, was abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain, but there are multiple ways to work around prevailing weather conditions."
"Tiger Shroff is a rebel for no reason. It is ironic then that he is the face (and/or kicks, punches, and washboard abdomen) of the Baaghi franchise. Rather than going against the tide, he is just swimming with the flow, and doing it with aggression and flexibility to camouflage his one-dimensional streak.In an era where every young star is constantly breaking barriers, avoiding stereotypes, and pushing the envelope in terms of acting, here is a Tiger Shroff whose filmography is merely a large blob of homogeneity. No one can take away the huge base of popularity he enjoys or the box office records set by his films, most recently Siddharth Anand's espionage thriller War from last year and Ahmed Khan's action drama Baaghi 2 from two years ago. But since he is stuck, comfortably so, in his image of an action hero, one cannot help but worry that he'll get jaded or burn out very soon, if not already.His defense is rather simplistic: ""In the industry which has so much talent and so much competition, it is very difficult to create an identity for oneself. So whatever little I am today it is because of the action genre. Yes, action does takes its toll but as long as I have my youth and physicality, I will continue with it."" The place where he comes from seems logical. But in the long run, his plan may be thwarted by the fact that this genre may soon become too convenient for him to venture out of, and try something new. Worse, his extremely loyal fan base may not accept him in any other avatar, especially if it is not something he is exceptionally good at.Going by his recent confession, Tiger is quite conscious and mindful of the expectation from his fan base. ""I got a lot of feedback from my fans saying that we are used to seeing you as a one man army and you take on machines, people single-handedly, but here I was a college guy who was getting bullied and beaten up and they couldn’t digest that. It didn’t go down too well with my audience,"" he said on the failure of his last solo release, Punit Malhotra's campus caper Student of the Year 2 in 2019.","Rather than going against the tide, he is just swimming with the flow, and doing it with aggression and flexibility to camouflage his one-dimensional streak.In an era where every young star is constantly breaking barriers, avoiding stereotypes, and pushing the envelope in terms of acting, here is a Tiger Shroff whose filmography is merely a large blob of homogeneity.

"Formula 1 2020: From Mercedes gunning for title double to McLaren leading midfield battle, success metrics for each team in new season.For 2020, Mercedes have a clear target ahead of them — win their seventh consecutive title double; but most-importantly, helping Hamilton equal Michael Schumacher's record of seven Drivers' Championship titles.Red Bull Racing team by its own admission are gunning for the Drivers' Championship with Max Verstappen — with the aim to make him the sport's youngest champion.For 2020, less than fourth place would be embarrassing and could put a question mark on Renault's commitment to Formula 1The Formula 1 circus is already setting shop at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne, Australia. The opening round of the 2020 Formula 1 season will be contested this weekend and the big question on everyone's mind is form factor — which team lies where in the pecking order? Frankly, the Formula 1 season is long enough and we've seen form factor ebb and flow as the season progresses. In which case, we thought it's best to define what success could look like for each team in 2020.The former world champion team started the hybrid-turbo era of Formula 1 with a bang — beating Ferrari in 2014 and Red Bull Racing in 2015. However, they've faced a steady decline in performances ever since. In 2016 and 2017, the team fought in the mid-field — finishing 5th in both seasons. In 2018 and 2019, the team finished in 10th and last place — in fact, last season was the team's worst in many years. They scored a solitary point courtesy Robert Kubica's measured drive (and some luck!) in the rainy German Grand Prix. In 2020, the team would be fighting battles on two fronts. First, trying to lift themselves from the bottom-most slot in the Constructors' Championship — by trying to be more involved in the mid-field battle rather than making up the numbers. Second, the team would be eager to rejuvenate and re-energise the legacy and aura around the brand — Williams. Along with poor performances in the last two seasons, their sloppiness was evident, too. Let's hope Wiliams is able to resurrect and do merit to their experience, resources and passion.","For 2020, Mercedes have a clear target ahead of them — win their seventh consecutive title double; but most-importantly, helping Hamilton equal Michael Schumacher's record of seven Drivers' Championship titles."

"Imphal: It rained goals in Imphal in an entertaining I-League match with Neroca emerging 4-3 winners against Punjab FC thanks to a hat-trick from Ghanaian striker Phillip Adjah Tettey at the Khuman Lumpak Stadium on Tuesday.Tettey gave Neroca the lead in the fifth minute before Dipanda Dicka restored parity three minutes later by scoring his 50th I-League goal. Tettey scored his second in the 37th minute to reclaim Neroca's advantage before substitute Girik Mahesh Khosla (59th) brought Punjab back to level terms near the hour mark.The visitors were reduced to 10 men after Yumnam Raju was sent off for a second bookable offence. Neroca soon raced to a 4-2 lead, courtesy of an own goal from Punjab's Danilo (75th) and shortly afterwards, Tettey scored his third of the match in the 82nd minute.Dicka converted a penalty in the 86th minute, but the home side held on for the remainder of match in a nervy finish.Gift Raikhan made wholesale changes to the home side's line-up. Dhananjoy Singh and Rojen Meitei were called upon at the back. Jiteshwor Singh dropped just behind Imran Khan in midfield. Khangam Horam and Singam Subash Singh started upfront.Punjab gaffer Yan Law made three changes. Yumnam Raju and Samuel Shadap were reinstated to the four-man defence. Sergio Barboza Jr. also made his return, starting out wide.The match kicked off to a blistering start. In the fourth minute, Sergio Barboza's menacing run was read by Himanshu Jangra, who made himself available for a pass with an overlapping run. Jangra picked out Dipanda Dicka inside the box, who had a crack first time but was denied by the crossbar.Just a minute later, Neroca caught Punjab napping on the counter. Jiteshwor Singh led the charge and found Imran Khan to his left. Khan played Tettey through on goal and the Ghanaian forward clinically slotted past Kiran Limbu for the opener.In the 8th minute, the home side shot themselves in the foot during a corner routine when Imran Khan conceded position outside the Punjab box, which led to a break. Sanju Pradhan ran the length of the pitch before squaring across goal for Dicka, who made no mistake this time to restore parity.Neroca pressed effectively, and it paid dividends in the 37th minute. Kiran Limbu's wayward pass was picked out, which put Tettey through on goal again. Danilo couldn't recover in time, and Tettey restored Neroca's advantage heading into the break.In the 48th minute, it was veteran Sanju Pradhan who played culprit and lost the possession to Tettey but with a hat-trick beckoning, he fluffed his lines with his finish.Near the hour mark, Sanju's set-piece delivery wasn't read by the Neroca backline, allowing substitute Khosla scored a spectacular equaliser.Yumnam Raju made matters worse for the Punjab outfit, after he picked up a red card for a second bookable offence.The Orange Brigade thoroughly capitalised on their one-man advantage.

The win was important for lifting the morale of the team.""Tributes poured in from the stands and the Kashmir squad for their young midfielder Ritwik Kumar Das, who couldn't be part of the action following the untimely death of his father.Chesterpoul Lyngdoh took his place in the XI, accounting for the only alteration David Robertson made to his line-up.Gift Raikhan, on the other hand, made three changes. Chanso Horam and Zodingliana Ralte were reinstated in midfield, while Ronald Singh started ahead of Boubacar Diarra up front.The hosts threatened early and had the better exchanges. The first knock arrived in the seventh minute, when Bazie Arman's wayward clearance turned out to be a good cross-field delivery for Mason Robertson instead.

Gokulam are still at seventh with 18 points in 13 games.The game started with the home side pressing hard for an early lead. Marcus Joseph along with Henry Kisseka and Garcia ensured that the Punjab FC defence was on high alert for most parts of the game.However, credit has to be given to Punjab's backline along with their Nepalese goalkeeper Kiran Kumar Limbu, who stood like a wall to ensure that the deadly attacking duo of the home side was not left with any space to find the back of the net.Gokulam, who have not been too solid in defence so far this season, were on their toes trying to stop Punjab's counter-attacks.However, Punjab soon struck in the 33rd minute through Dipanda Dicka, who made no mistakes in finding the back of the net after exploiting a defensive lapse and miscommunication between Gokulam's goalkeeper CK Ubaid and defender Mohammed Irshad.Trailing by a goal, Gokulam tried hard to equalize, attacking in short bursts. But, some gutsy goalkeeping and an alert Punjab defensive line ensured the first half came to an end with the visitors enjoying a 1-0 lead.The second period began with the hosts pressing hard but Punjab held firm to their advantage. Gokulam's lack of innovation in the final third ensured they had to work harder for that equaliser.Gokulam prayers were soon rewarded when a long-range effort by Garcia in the 63rd minute sneaked its way into the back of the net, giving the home side a much-needed leveller.Buoyed by the goal, they went on attacking spree in search of the lead but Punjab kept the Gokulam attacking line at bay.The Kerala side were unlucky not to find the net towards the end as Joseph fired in a long shot in the 81st minute that hit the post.

Brazilians do not need a passport to enter Paraguay so it was unclear why Ronaldinho had the fake documents in his possession.The brothers will remain in a maximum-security prison on the outskirts of Asuncion for as long as six months, or until the investigation is complete, judge Gustavo Amarilla said.“Ronaldinho’s freedom could lead to an obstruction (of justice) or an escape,” Amarilla told reporters. “His presence in the country is necessary.”The brothers offered a $770,000 property as a guarantee but prosecutor Marcelo Pecchi argued they were a flight risk.“The investigation is only beginning, we are looking into other conducts that may be related,” Pecchi told reporters.“If these people leave right now they will not be able to be brought to face trial because Brazil does not extradite its own citizens.”Although he last played professionally in 2015, Ronaldinho is still hugely popular with global football fans and advertisers and was invited to Paraguay by a local casino owner.","Former Brazil player Ronaldinho Gaucho, who was arrested for possessing a fake Paraguayan passport, must remain in jail in the South American country after a judge on Tuesday refused a request for him to be released into house arrest."

"Sao Paulo: Retired football star Ronaldinho and his brother are in jail in Paraguay after being accused of entering the country using fake passports. It was the latest in a string of incidents involving the 2002 World Cup winner and Barcelona icon, who officially retired in 2018 after several lackluster seasons.Here is a look back at some of the issues the Brazilian has faced off the pitch in recent years. Jailed former Brazil and Barcelona star Ronaldinho facing multiple legal issues off the pitch.Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto de Assis are jailed after they arrived in Asunción on Wednesday with fake passports. Their lawyer Sérgio Queiroz confirmed the documents were false, but argued they were a gift from a businessman, who has also been jailed.Ronaldinho and Assis had said they went to Asunción for business reasons. It is unclear why the former footballer entered Paraguay using the passport considering Brazilians can enter the neighboring country using their national ID card. A local prosecutor told Brazilian media the former footballer will be investigated for other alleged crimes, but did not reveal what these were.The Instituto Ronaldinho Gaúcho (IRG), which was closed in the end of 2010, was investigated on two occasions due to allegedly irregular contracts with the Porto Alegre city hall. The first probe came in 2012, with city councillors claiming that more than $100,000 was paid to the educational institute led by Ronaldinho. That investigation ended after politicians decided there was no ill intent by the footballer and his brother in the case.Three years later, state of Rio Grande do Sul prosecutors sought to open another case that was based on the 2012 probe, but this time they claimed the irregularities amounted to about $300,000. A judge later ruled there were no grounds to sentence the brothers.Ronaldinho was fined for building an illegal fishing platform and dock on the shores of the Guaiba river in his hometown of Porto Alegre in 2015. He challenged the decision for years until a judge seized his passport, claiming he had to pay damages of about $2 million.Despite not having his passport, Ronaldinho became a tourism ambassador for the administration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in September. Later, he paid the fine and had his documents returned.The former footballer has been under investigation since the start of the year because of his links with a cryptocurrency company called 18kRonaldinho, which promised lucrative returns. Victims told media the initiative was actually a pyramid scheme and demanded damages of more than $65 million from the company. Ronaldinho's lawyer says he is not involved with it.Barcelona distanced itself from its former star's support of Bolsonaro, a fringe far-right congressman who rose to power in 2019.After the former footballer endorsed Bolsonaro, club spokesman Josep Vives said in a press conference in 2018 that Barcelona's democratic values ""do not coincide with the words we have heard from the candidate (Bolsonaro).""Vives added that Barça supports freedom of speech, but Ronaldinho has been a less frequent attendee of club events since. He used to be paid about 100,000 euros for each appearance.Newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported in July that Ronaldinho had multiple debts amounting to more than $2 million. At least four properties belonging to the former football star have been auctioned by a court in Rio Grande do Sul state.","Ronaldinho's legal trouble in Paraguary is latest in a string of incidents involving the 2002 World Cup winner and Barcelona icon, who officially retired in 2018 after several lackluster seasons.

"Reigning world champion PV Sindhu will lead a substantially truncated Indian squad to the prestigious All England Badminton Championships that get under way at the Arena Birmingham on Wednesday.Seven top Indian players who featured in the five 32-berth draws by virtue of their current Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings have chosen to give the 110th edition of the elite, tradition-drenched World Tour Super 1000 competition a miss, thanks to the coronavirus (Covid-19) scare. All England Championships 2020: Tough draws for PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal amidst reduced participation in tournament with coronavirus threat.Players of the calibre of HS Prannoy, Sameer Verma and Saurabh Verma, and the country's two top doubles pairs of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty (ranked tenth in the world) and Manu Attri-Sumeeth Reddy have decided to drop out of the US$1.1 million prize money tournament. Rankireddy and Shetty, currently ranked tenth in the world, had missed last year's event as well, with the former having been laid low by a shoulder injury.The withdrawals, announced late last week by the Badminton Association of India (BAI), have left Sindhu with the task of shouldering the Indian pennant in the company of Kidambi Srikanth, Sai Praneeth, Lakshya Sen, Parupalli Kashyap, Pranaav Jerry Chopra, N Sikki Reddy, Saina Nehwal and Ashwini Ponnappa.For the two Indian women who have been carrying the country's hopes in the stellar singles event for the past few years, the draw has been somewhat cruel. Sindhu, who has failed to win a single title since her World Championship win in Basel last August, and has never gone beyond the semi-final stage at the All England, has been given the sixth seeding, and opens her campaign against the redoubtable American-Chinese, Beiwen Zhang, ranked 14th on the BWF ladder.The lissome 24-year-old Indian carries a wafer-thin 5-4 head-to-head advantage against Zhang, whom she had beaten comprehensively by a 21-14, 21-6 scoreline in Basel on her way to the world title, but to whom she lost narrowly at the Korean Open by a 21-7, 22-24, 15-21 margin, after holding a match-point in the second game of their extended battle, barely a month after the 2019 World Championships.Should Sindhu take Zhang in her stride, she also faces a tricky second round against the winner of the first-round duel between Thailand's Nitchaon Jindapol and South Korea's Sung Ji Hyun. The Indian ace holds a 5-2 winning record against the Thai girl, but lost to the 21st ranked Jindapol on the last occasion that they met. Sindhu has a shaky 8-8 career record against the 27-year-old 12th ranked Korean, having lost to Sung on the three most recent occasions that they have clashed in the past two years.Crossing the second hurdle will put the reigning world champion up for a quarter-final meeting with the fourth-seeded Japanese, Nozomi Okuhara, whom she had thrashed at 21-7, 21-7 in the Basel World Championship final, to gain sweet revenge for her narrow three-game loss at the hands of the diminutive Japanese in the epic 2017 World Championship final. All these girls are packed in the top half of the draw, dominated by world No 1 and defending champion, Chen Yufei of China; and one of them is slated to clash with the title-holder in the semi-final.As for Saina, whose recent lack of good results has resulted in a slide to a world ranking of No 20, she has the toughest of assignments in her lung-opener, against the pocket dynamo from Japan, Akane Yamaguchi, seeded third this time. Both girls have held the world No 1 position in the past, but age is very much in favour of the 22-year-old Japanese, who should have little trouble dealing with the Indian, considering the fact that Saina will turn 30 two days after the conclusion of the All England.While the two Indian women singles exponents face a major struggle in their event, the draw has been relatively kind to at least two of the four Indian men (from the original seven) left in the men's singles draw.Bhamidipati Sai Praneeth, ranked 10th in the world, plays China's Zhao Jun Peng, whom he has met just once in the past, losing in straight sets in the 2016 Macau Open. A win over the 36th ranked Zhao will take Praneeth into a projected second-round meeting with Chinese seventh seed Shi Yuqi, who has reached the All England final twice, winning the title in 2018.Young Lakshya Sen, who has fought his way into the top 30 in the world, faces the 23-year-old Hong Kong player, Lee Cheuk Yiu, in the first round. Sen, as a 16-year-old, had lost to Lee at the 2018 Australian Open at 19-21 in the third game of a long-drawn battle, in the only match they have played, but has improved enormously since then, and has a fine chance of moving into a second-round clash with the winner of the opening-round duel between Thailand's Sitthikom Thammasin and the second-seeded Dane and 2017 world champion, Viktor Axelsen.Sadly, India's best men's player until a year ago, Srikanth, has slipped to the 14th rank in the world and has a tough opener against the formidable two-time former world champion and 2016 Olympic gold medallist, Chen Long of China, seeded third this time. The 27-year-old Guntur lad, who lost at the quarter-final stage to eventual champion Momota at last year's championships, has a 2-6 record against the lanky Chinese star, although the most recent meeting between the two ended in a 21-13, 0-0 (retired) result in favour of the Indian at the Hong Kong Open last November.The fourth Indian in the men's singles draw, Parupalli Kashyap, has to run the Indonesian gauntlet if he hopes to progress in the competition. The 33 year old first takes on Shesar Hiren Rhustavito, whom he has never bumped into in the past; and, if he makes it to the second round, would most likely have to deal with the No 4 seed, Anthony Sinisuka Ginting, arguably the fastest singles player on the planet.In the continued absence of Japan's reigning world champion Kento Momota, who is still to recover from the physical and emotional scars of a road accident in Kuala Lumpur at the end of the Malaysian Masters, the world No 2, Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei, has been given pride of place at Birmingham. His first opponent would be Mark Caljouw, a player promoted from the reserves to take the place of the withdrawn Sameer Verma.With the withdrawal of both the main men's doubles combination, India does not have any interest in the event, per se. But the sole women's doubles team of Ponnappa and Sikki Reddy has a chance to progress at least to the second round, for they take on the none-too-formidable Australian pair of Gronya Somerville and Setyana Mapasa, before they possibly cross swords with the former World no 1 duo of Ayaka Takahashi and Misaki Matsutomo, seeded seventh this time.Things do not look even half as rosy for the mixed doubles pairing of Chopra and Sikki Reddy, as they have the onerous task of taking on top seeds and defending champions, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong in their very first outing. It would take nothing short of a miracle for the unconsidered Indians to beat the long-reigning world No 1 pair, who are looking to make their third successive All England final.",Reigning world champion PV Sindhu will lead a substantially truncated Indian squad to the prestigious All England Badminton Championships that get under way at the Arena Birmingham on Wednesday.

"Oil experts are left scratching their head in the aftermath of the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna held on March 5 and 6 as most variables of the oil market are left in flux. In a move that has shaken the crude landscape, Saudi Arabia has launched an oil war against Russia by announcing that it will hike oil production 12.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) from April, and has also offered deep discounts to its buyers, potentially swamping an already oversupplied oil market.The exacting decision by Riyadh to spike production was triggered by the failure on Friday to strike a deal with Russia on a new round of OPEC+ production cuts to arrest swooning oil prices owing to the novel coronavirus.Russia, Saudi Arabia showdown over crude prices arms oil firms with additional bargaining power; exchequer can hope for windfall on savingsA surge of shale oil from American production sites — today, the US is the world’s largest oil producer — has kept the pipelines brimming over. In an attempt to rebalance the markets, OPEC led by Saudi Arabia plus non-OPEC producers, like Russia—forming an unwieldy alliance called the OPEC+ group--have been making quota-based group cuts to production. Under the existing pact, which kicked in last December and ends this month, a total of 2.7mb/d oil was taken off the market.However, since January, the coronavirus outbreak has eaten into Chinese demand and supply chains slamming global oil demand—petroleum prices have already fallen by 30 percent this year. A recommending body of the OPEC+ cartel, comprising representatives of producing countries, called the joint technical committee recommended a 600,000 b/d reduction in production to bring relief to the oil market. However, Riyadh wanted to cut production by 1.5 mb/d after March—a proposal that was unpalatable to Kremlin resulting in collapsed talks.Since the kingdom’s retaliatory decision, the market response has been violent with Brent crude futures plunging Sunday night by the most since the Gulf War began in 1991 and oil prices diving by 20 percent.The complicacy in stitching together this fractious, large group of elite oil producers are located in divergent political and economic interests. The Kremlin’s budget easily accommodates a $40 a barrel oil whereas Riyadh is under pressure to keep prices over $60 to support Saudi Aramco’s share price and also to realize their ambitious Vision 2030 reforms that include weaning the economy off oil.Additionally, Moscow has become wary of yielding market share to US shale and new producers, like Canada and Norway. The endless clamping down on production was hurting Russia—which was reflected in its weak compliance to the OPEC+ pact. Additionally, Russian intent for not agreeing to deepened cuts in the second quarter is directed at breaking the back of the shale industry by ensuring oversupply heavily compresses crude price ensuring that most of the shale industry that operates at breakeven prices are weeded out.This comes in the heels of the still-raw wound inflicted by the Trump administration in the form of sanctions imposed on Rosneft Trading and its consequent deleterious impact on the Nord Stream 2 project--a new export gas pipeline running from Russia to Europe across the Baltic Sea. The US energy secretary Dan Brouillette recently said at the Munich security conference that this means the project will face “a very long delay because Russia doesn’t have the technology”. Russia, reportedly, has now turned to Kiev to deliver this gas. Nord Stream 2, which would have pumped as much as 55 billion cubic meters of gas annually from producing fields in Siberia to Germany has become a new source of tension as the Trump administration is aggressively seeking energy markets in Europe and Asia. The decision to walk away from extending or deepening the existing pact is Moscow’s retort to foil the U.S. oil strategy.",The exacting decision by Riyadh to spike production was triggered by the failure on Friday to strike a deal with Russia on a new round of OPEC+ production cuts to arrest swooning oil prices owing to the novel coronavirus.
"Oil prices plummeted around 30 percent on Monday after Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling prices and set plans for a dramatic increase in crude production next month, starting a price war even as spread of the coronavirus erodes global demand growth.Prices fell by as much as a third following Saudi Arabia’s move after Russia balked at making a further steep output cut proposed by Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stabilise oil markets hit by worry over the economic impact of the coronavirus.Brent crude futures were down $12.23, or 27 percent, at $33.04 a barrel, after earlier dropping to $31.02, their lowest since 12 February 2016. Brent futures are on track for their biggest daily decline since 17 January 1991, at the start of the first Gulf War.Oil plunges to lowest level in 4 years on coronavirus impact; all you need to know about falling crude pricesRepresentational image. In January this year, the Brent crude was trading close to $72 per barrel. In two months, the crude price crashed more than 50 percent to $33 per barrel as the coronavirus epidemic is yet to be brought under control.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell by $11.88, or 29 percent, to $29.40 a barrel, after touching $27.34, also the lowest since 12 February 2016. The US benchmark was potentially heading for its biggest decline on record, surpassing a 33 percent fall in January 1991.The disintegration of the grouping called OPEC+ - made up of OPEC plus other producers including Russia - ends more than three years of cooperation on supporting the market, most recently to stabilise prices under threat from the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.Saudi Arabia plans to boost its crude output above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April after the current deal to curb production expires at the end of March, two sources told Reuters on Sunday.The world’s biggest oil exporter is attempting to punish Russia, the world’s second-largest producer, for not supporting the production cuts proposed last week by the OPEC.Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers last battled for market share like this between 2014 and 2016 to try to squeeze out production from the United States, which has grown to become the world’s biggest oil producer as flows from shale oil fields doubled its output over the last decade.“The prognosis for the oil market is even more dire than in November 2014, when such a price war last started, as it comes to a head with the signi?cant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus,” Goldman Sachs said.Saudi Arabia over the weekend cut its official selling prices for April for all crude grades to all destinations by between $6 and $8 a barrel.Coronavirus outbreak continues, oil demand to declineChina’s efforts to curtail the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the world’s second-largest economy and curtailed shipments to the biggest oil importer.And the spread of the virus to other major economies such as Italy and South Korea and the growing number of cases in the United States have increased concerns that oil demand will slump this year.Goldman Sachs and other major banks such as Morgan Stanley have cut their demand growth forecasts, with Morgan Stanley predicting China will have zero demand growth in 2020. Goldman sees a contraction of 150,000 bpd in global demand.Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for Brent to $30 for the second and third quarters of 2020.Last month, oil prices edged higher as investors hoped the world’s biggest producers would cut output more while they largely shrugged off forecasts of slumping demand due to the coronavirus outbreak in top oil importer China.The OPEC had lowered its 2020 demand forecast for its crude by 200,000 bpd, prompting expectations the producer group and its allies, known as OPEC+, could cut output further.“The Russians have pretty much signaled that everyone is on board for OPEC+ delivering deeper production cuts,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. “Crude’s price action possibly suggests a firm bottom is in place. As long as the coronavirus does not show strong signs that the spreading of the virus is intensifying, WTI crude could make a run towards the mid-$50s.”In 2019, oil prices had risen more than 20 percent but there were no sharp spikes and crude futures barely sniffed $70 a barrel despite attacks on the world’s biggest oil producer, sanctions that crippled crude exports of two OPEC members and gigantic supply cuts from big oil producing countries.","Brent crude futures were down $12.23, or 27 percent, at $33.04 a barrel, after earlier dropping to $31.02, their lowest since 12 February 2016.Saudi Arabia plans to boost its crude output above 10 million bpd in April after the current deal to curb production expires at the end of Marchr"
"New Delhi: Petrol prices slipped below Rs 71-mark for the first time in eight months on Monday as India looks set to reap windfall from a price war among oil producers leading to international crude prices crashing by their biggest margin since the 1991 Gulf war.International oil prices crashed by close to 31 percent, the second-largest margin on record, after the disintegration of the OPEC+ alliance triggered an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.Brent futures plummeted to about $31 a barrel on Monday as Goldman Sachs warned prices could drop to near $20.For India, which imports over 84 percent of its oil needs, the slump would lead to lower import bill and a cut in retail prices but will harm already stressed upstream firms such as ONGC.Lower oil prices will also help economy from its 11-year low growth rate by way of reducing input cost for a lot of sectors.In Delhi, petrol prices dropped to Rs 70.59 a litre, the lowest since early July 2019, and diesel rate were cut to Rs 63.26, according to a price notification of state-owned firms. Petrol price falls below Rs 71, first time in eight months; India to gain from Saudi Arabia, Russia oil price warRepresentational image. Fuel prices have been on the decline since 27 February on international trends. Petrol prices have in all fallen by Rs 1.42 a litre since then and diesel rates have dropped by Rs 1.44 per litre.But the only dampener in the entire scheme of things is rupee which settled 23 paise down at 74.10 against the US dollar. A weaker rupee means India pays more for buying the same amount of commodity from overseas. It will also help lower inflation rate.According to the oil ministry's petroleum planning and analysis cell, India is likely to pay $105.58 billion or Rs 7.43 lakh crore on import of 225 million tonnes of crude oil in the fiscal year 2019-20, which ends this month. This compares to $111.9 billion (Rs 7.83 lakh crore) paid for import of 226.5 million tonnes of oil in 2018-19.The 2019-20 projection is based on average price of $66 per barrel for the basket of crude oil India imports and average exchange rate of 71 to a US dollar.Oil company officials said the import bill will fall in the next fiscal beginning April but an estimation cannot be made given the extreme volatility in the oil and currency market.It certainly will translate into lower retail prices of petrol and diesel in the coming days as the current rates do not reflect the slump in international prices, they said.Retail prices of the day are based on average price of benchmark international fuel of the preceeding fortnight. And the drop in prices to $31 will get reflected in retail prices over the next 7-10 days.The moving average helps narrow the extreme volatility in the prices, they said.On the negative side, lower oil prices mean they become more competitive versus renewable energy and delay switchover to cleaner fuels in fight against climate change.Industry association Assocham said the fall in crude prices will help India recover as low prices of crude can be a demand driver while also taming the inflation.However, Morgan Stanley believes that the drop in oil prices may not be good news for the economy as the gains will remain capped due to the overall weakness in the economy given the coronavirus-related health scare.The decline in oil prices, it said, will negatively impact the capex outlook for oil related sectors as well as oil producing countries.The fall in oil prices comes at a time when the global economy is already reeling under the impact of coronavirus, which has dented demand across sectors and economies.","International oil prices crashed by close to 31 percent, the second-largest margin on record, after the disintegration of the OPEC+ alliance triggered an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia Brent futures plummeted to about $31 a barrel on Monday as Goldman Sachs warned prices could drop to near $20 "
