"Investigations into the inter-district illegal abortion racket have revealed that the suspects were practising out of a clinic that did not have a valid licence from the local civic body and had used forged prescriptions for at least five years. The Solapur police bust the racket after a raid on a nursing clinic operated by Dr Shrikant Marda (68) at Mangalvedha in the district and arrested six people, including two doctors and a medicine supplier. Dr Marda, a child specialist, did not renew licence from the local self-governing body for the clinic in 2015, stating that he was not willing to run it due to old age. However, when police raided the clinic, three women who had been administered local anaesthetia were found and action taken. Senior inspector D B Patil of Mangalwedha police station told TOI, “Dr Marda did not renew permission to run the clinic in 2015. He wrote to the Mangalwedha municipal council that he was not willing to run the clinic due to old age. However, he continued to run the clinic without licence.” The officer said police records seized from Dr Marda’s clinic show that letterheads of a doctor couple were used to write prescriptions. “The letterheads belonged to a doctor, who passed away in 2015, and his wife. The 72-year-old woman doctor was shocked when we approached her for inquiry,” Patil said. Police have collected sample signatures from the woman doctor and those of her husband to match with the prescriptions issued by Dr Marda. The investigating team has also collected CCTV footage from Marda clinic, which is likely to provide further clues and arrest of more suspects. Patil added that the other arrested suspect, Dr Vilas Sawant, a homeopath, would use a portable sonography machine and also place orders online for medicines and injections required for performing abortions. “Dr Sawant, who is already facing three similar cases, used to order medicines online. We recovered his email ID and found that he had ordered medicines needed for abortion to the tune of Rs 54,200 in one year,” said the officer. Police have also arrested Suraj Babar (37), who has a clinic in Kadegaon of Sangli district. He has studied only up to the tenth standard and later did a course in naturopathy. “Babar used to go the house of women patients with portable sonography machine,” sources in Solapur police said. Patil said call data records of Dr Marda, Dr Sawant, Babar and the agent show that they were in constant touch with each other. The Solapur police have arrested Suresh Kumbhar from Karnataka, who would supply medicines to the doctors, and the husbands of two of the women found at Dr Marda’s clinic. Patil said police had recorded the statements of the three women who were found at the nursing home and X ray clinic, under section 164 Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC), which will be admissible before court during the hearing. Preliminary investigation found that all three women had female fetuses and had got admitted for abortion. Police have now focused their investigation on how the trio used to dispose of the fetuses after abortion. Police have also identified an agent who works as a technician in a pathological laboratory. Patil said the agent would soon be arrested","Investigations into the inter-district illegal abortion racket have revealed that the suspects were practising out of a clinic that did not have a valid licence from the local civic body and had used forged prescriptions for at least five years. «The letterheads belonged to a doctor, who passed away in 2015, and his wife.

"The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the state's interest in protecting the life of a foetus and therefore the ceiling of 20 weeks for abortion cannot be extended in a blanket manner. The government said that an unborn child cannot protect itself from the harm designed by his/her own mother. The Centre's reply came on a plea which has challenged the constitutional validity of section 3(2) (b) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 by which the ceiling of 20 weeks is fixed for an abortion. The petitioners have sought fixing of rational ceiling at 26 weeks instead of 20 weeks under the act. The petitioners have also sought quashing of a provision which restricts abortions only in case of saving the life of a pregnant woman. The Centre said that the legislature in its wisdom incorporated strict conditions for carrying out abortions, keeping in mind that the state was morally and duty bound as the guardian of its citizens and has the power to safeguard the life of a foetus in the womb after it attains the stage of viability. ""Petitioners on their right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the interest of the state in protecting the life of foetus in the womb, especially from the point of viability i.e from the period of 20 weeks onwards. ""It is a settled law that personal freedom of choice of an individual cannot curtail the freedom or choice of other individuals, specially the most vulnerable and persons who are defenseless. Unborn child cannot protect itself from the harm designed by his/her very own mother,"" the Centre's affidavit said. It said that several studies have repeatedly found that even in cases where serious abnormalities were detected after the twentieth week, pregnant woman who chose to carry the pregnancy to term were able to better cope with the loss, mental anguish and trauma as compared to woman who chose to terminate the pregnancy. The government's affidavit said that India's high maternal mortality rate is on account of woman seeking unsafe abortions beyond the prescribed ceiling of 20 weeks when no foetal abnormalities are detected. It said that ratio of foetal abnormalities detected in children is extremely rare and hence the same cannot be attributed as the reason for India high maternal mortality rate.","The Centre has told the Supreme Court that the right to reproductive autonomy does not outweigh the state's interest in protecting the life of a foetus and therefore the ceiling of 20 weeks for abortion cannot be extended in a blanket manner.

"India has recorded over 61 lakh abortions in around last five years since 2014-15 till date, official data from states and Union territories in the health management and information system shows. Health ministry presented the data in the Lok Sabha on Friday in written reply to a question. Though the government data has not recorded illegally performed abortions, public health experts say up to 50% of total abortions are unsafe. The abortion data assumes importance because it reflects women – more particularly maternal health, as well as women’s reproductive rights and choices. Elaborating on the measures taken by the government to reduce unsafe abortions outside medical facilities, minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey told Lok Sabha provision of comprehensive abortion care (CAC) services is an important component of the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) programme under the government. The National Health Mission (NHM) provides support to the states and Union Territories for various activities to promote safe abortion. Provision of comprehensive safe abortion services are available at public health facilities round the clock, where trained medical practitioners are posted, the minister said. Comprehensive abortion care (CAC) has been developed and disseminated to the states and Union Territories, and certification of private and NGO sector facilities by district-level committees to provide quality medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) services. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules and Regulations, 2003, monthly reporting of total number of cases of abortions in prescribed format is mandatory which is sent from MTP sites to the district authorities. The states and UTs send compiled report on MTP cases to ministry of health and family welfare on quarterly basis.","India has recorded over 61 lakh abortions in around last five years since 2014-15 till date, official data from states and Union territories in the health management and information system shows.

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation. Pompeo leveled his charge amid an escalating crisis with Iran following a US drone strike on Friday in Iraq that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite foreign paramilitary and espionage service, the Quds Force. ""Iran has refused to join the regional and international consensus for peace and is, in fact, actively working to undermine the peace process by continuing its long global effort to support militant groups there,"" Pompeo said at a State Department news conference. Pompeo named the Taliban as one of the militant groups he accused Iran of using to undermine Afghanistan peace efforts. He also referred to the ""Tora Bora and the Mullah Dadullah Group,"" little-known organizations whose strengths, relevance and contacts with Iran were not immediately clear. ""The Taliban's entanglement in Iran's dirty work will only harm the Afghanistan peace process,"" Pompeo said. Tehran long has maintained high-level Taliban contacts. It has held consultations with Taliban officials on their ongoing negotiations with the United States on a US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan that would lead to intra-Afghan talks on a political accord to end decades of fighting. Iran is a haven for some insurgent families and has supplied limited quantities of weapons to the insurgents to keep pressure on US forces near its border with Afghanistan, according to Western officials. But Tehran also maintains close ties with Kabul and regional experts cast its relationship with the Taliban as hedging its bets in case the militants return to power. Tehran also sees the Taliban as a counter force to Islamic State's Afghan affiliate.","US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation.

"After bearing the brunt of jihadist dynamite and looting by thieves, the archaeological treasures of Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are facing a new and possibly more daunting threat: climate change. Nestled in the heart of the Hindu Kush mountains, the Bamiyan valley's picturesque cliffs - where centuries-old Buddha statues were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 - still contain a network of caves housing temples, monasteries, and Buddhist paintings. The valley is also home to the silk-road era Shahr-e Gholghola fortress and the Shar-e Zohak citadel to the east. Experts say that a pattern of dry spells followed by heavy rain, and larger than usual spring snowmelts is putting this historic art and architecture at risk of destruction. Afghan officials warned in a 2016 United Nations report that the structures ""may collapse and suffer from severe erosion""due to conditions directly linked to climate change. ""The erosion processes are much faster, the rains more devastating and the wind erosion stronger, which has an extremely harsh impact on the sites,"" Philippe Marquis, the director of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan, told AFP. Marquis - who has explored and worked in the region for decades - explains that Afghanistan ""is very fragile geologically, especially as vegetation cover has greatly diminished"" due to deforestation. French imaging company Iconem concurred, saying Shar-e Zohak is ""very fragile"" due to erosion that has increased considerably over the last 30 years. For Baqe Ghulami, 21, who hails from Saikhand district in northern Bamiyan, climate change has long been a reality resident have had to confront. ""The weather is changing, now summers are warmer and winters colder,"" he says, while overlooking the empty spaces where the two towering Buddha statues once stood. Many of the artefact’s pre-date the arrival of Islam to the region but despite the fact they come from another religion, the residents who spoke with AFP proudly defended the area's history as their own. From the empty caves, visitors can see the Cultural Center, which began construction in 2015 but has yet to be completed. It aims to educate visitors about the urgent need to preserve the area's heritage. ""There is no benefit if people just see (the sites) without information,"" says Ali Reza Mushfiq, 26, director of the Department of Archeology at Bamiyan University, complaining that a dearth of funding has left many in the dark -- including his own students who lack access to books. The archaeologist readily admits that ""erosion is increasing"", but believes the real danger comes from ""human influence at the site"", including looters, who are rampant in Afghanistan. The Shar-e Gholghola Fortress and other key sites are now guarded to protect against such issues. The removal of landmines from the area has seen thousands visit in recent years, but the influx of recent visitors has done little to change the reality on the ground. ""We must start training... (the) local people to teach them how not to destroy the site,"" says Mushfiq, adding that some residents continue to store feed and house livestock in the historic sites. A stone's throw from the cave of the great Buddha, Ammanullah, 37, says he and his family have moved into one of the caves, building a home inside made of odds and ends with plastic sheets for windows. He is not alone, many other poor families have sought shelter next to ancient artefacts and structures. ""There are 18 families here... we didn't have other options,"" says Ammanullah. ""We would go if we were given a house."" For Marquis, however, the greatest threat does not come from local residents encroaching on the site or from theft. ""Even if it is dramatic, it is much less damaging than the destruction caused by erosion,"" he said. Mitigating the impacts of erosion and the effects of climate change would cost billions of dollars in Afghanistan, but the war-torn country has little ability to shoulder such a burden. The Global Adaptation Initiative, run by the University of Notre Dame in the US, currently ranks Afghanistan 173 out of the 181 countries it scored in terms of a nation's vulnerability to climate change and its ability to adapt.","After bearing the brunt of jihadist dynamite and looting by thieves, the archaeological treasures of Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are facing a new and possibly more daunting threat: climate change.

Afghanistan has its embassy in New Delhi. Stating that the establishment of the consulate will usher in new opportunities, Afghanistan deputy foreign minister Naheed Esar said: “While there exists air connectivity between Kabul, Delhi and Mumbai, we would like to add Hyderabad among the newer destinations in this corridor.” She added that economic ties between the countries would focus in sectors such as transit, energy and trade. Esar invited businesses from the city to establish bases in Afghanistan. The minister said the establishment of the consulate came at a crucial juncture for Afghanistan, when it is transitioning from being an aid-recipient country to a self-reliant one. Highlighting another dimension of Hyderabad’s relationship with Kabul, state home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali said that there were many Afghan students pursuing their studies here. Besides education he also stressed on the need to build trade ties including in traditional items. Charge d’affaires of the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, Tahir Qaadiri said that since Hyderabad was known to be an IT hub, it would be interesting to see a ‘silicon valley’ established in Afghanistan as well. “The inauguration of the consulate here will open south India to our nation,” he said and added that a Hyderabad-Jalalabad sister city partnership could be on the horizon.

"England paceman Jofra Archer may miss out on second Test against South Africa after skipping bowling practice at Newlands on Wednesday. Archer, who took six wickets in the first Test defeat at Pretoria including 5-102 in the second innings, did bat in the nets and took part in fielding drills but a sore right elbow kept him from bowling. A decision on the 24-year-old would have to be made just before the start of the Test on Friday. He had been a doubt for the first match after suffering from the virus that swept through the England camp on their arrival in South Africa but recovered in time to play in the 107-run defeat. For the first time on tour, England's entire 19-man squad were at practice on Wednesday including spinner Jack Leech, who has suffered the longest from the flu bug.

England have said they will support the idea after 2023 while Australia are to give serious consideration to the plan. Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported that South Africa would oppose the idea, despite the country becoming the first to host a four-day Test when they played Zimbabwe in 2017.

"In a marginal relief to airlines as oil prices shoot up, the aviation ministry has decided to discontinue levy of airport operator charge or fuel throughput charge at all airports, airstrips and heliports across India with immediate effect. It said Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) “should take into account the amount in this revenue stream and duly compensate the airport operator / Airports Authority of India by suitably recalibrating other tariffs during their determinations of airport tariffs.” The decision has been taken to “uphold affordability and sustainability of air passenger and air cargo transportation.” The ministry order says: “Fuel-related charges are charged variously either in three parts as (a) Airport Operator Charges, (b) Fuel Infrastructure Charges (FIC), and (c) Into Plane (ITP) Charges or as a composite of the three, generally called Fuel Throughput Charge (FTC), at the airports, airstrips and helipads across the country. At some airports, fuel supply is provided on open access basis. “Numerous rounds of stakeholder consultations have been held by the ministry in order to rationalise the present mechanism of invoicing of ATF fuel throughput charges.… It was seen inter-alia that the global best practices at airports avoid levying a double charge by way of land rental on fuel suppliers for the use of the land at the airport and a market access or concession fee for providing commercial opportunity when there is no underlying tangible service being rendered by the airport operator,” it adds.","In a marginal relief to airlines as oil prices shoot up, the aviation ministry has decided to discontinue levy of airport operator charge or fuel throughput charge at all airports, airstrips and heliports across India with immediate effect.

"Jeff Bezos met federal investigators in April 2019 after they received information about the alleged hack of the billionaire’s mobile phone by Saudi Arabia, the Guardian has been told. Bezos was interviewed by investigators at a time when the FBI was conducting an investigation into the Israeli technology company NSO Group, according to a person who was present at the meeting. Reuters first reported on Thursday that the FBI was investigating the role of NSO in possible hacks of US residents and companies, citing four people familiar with the inquiry. Reuters also reported that the FBI had met Bezos in connection with the alleged hacking of his phone. The FBI investigation into NSO has been under way since 2017, when officials were seeking information about whether the company had received any of the code it needed to infect smartphones from US hackers, Reuters reported. In a statement provided by the strategy firm Mercury Public Affairs, NSO said: “We have not been contacted by any US law enforcement agencies at all about any such matters and have no knowledge or awareness of any investigative actions. Therefore, we cannot comment further.” NSO has previously said government customers are the ones who do the hacking. Two independent investigators at the United Nations, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, revealed last week that they have launched their own inquiry into allegations that Bezos’s phone was hacked on 1 May 2018 after he apparently received a video file from a WhatsApp account belonging to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. The investigators are examining whether the alleged hack occurred in connection to Bezos’s role as the owner of the Washington Post. An analysis of the alleged hack that was commissioned by the Amazon founder has not concluded what kind of spyware was used. NSO said last week it was “shocked and appalled” by allegations that Bezos’s phone had been hacked. The company also said: “We can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance. Saudi Arabia has called the claim that it was involved in the hack “absurd”. A person who was present at the April 2019 meeting between Bezos and investigators said it took place at the offices of Bezos’s lawyer, Matthew Schwartz, at the firm of Boies Schiller Flexner. An attorney for Bezos declined to comment. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has separately referred a civil claim it filed against NSO last year to the Department of Justice. WhatsApp has said it believed NSO has violated criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a federal law that is used to prosecute hackers. WhatsApp has claimed 1,400 users were hacked using NSO technology over a two-week period in April-May last year, after NSO was allegedly able to exploit a WhatsApp vulnerability that was later fixed. NSO has staunchly denied the claim and has said it would vigorously defend itself in court. NSO has faced scrutiny after multiple claims that its technology has been used against journalists, human rights campaigners, academics and high-ranking government officials. Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto Munk school, which investigates hacking cases, said this week it believed the New York Times reporter Ben Hubbard, who has written a book about Prince Mohammed, had been targeted by spyware known as Pegasus, which is made by NSO. NSO has said its technology is used by clients to combat crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates claims of abuse of its technology. The company has previously denied ever being contacted by the US Department of Justice. NSO has also said its technology cannot be used against US mobile phone numbers, though WhatsApp has disputed that claim in its lawsuit against NSO. The Guardian has been told that federal investigators received further information about NSO technology in early 2019, including detailed information about how Pegasus works, ways the malware can self-destruct and become undetectable, and that it can automatically uninstall. New revelations about the alleged hacking of Bezos’s phone have caught the attention of a handful of politicians in Washington who have sought more information about the alleged hack, including whether there was any evidence that Saudi Arabia had infected phones of any members of the Trump administration.","Two independent investigators at the United Nations, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, revealed last week that they have launched their own inquiry into allegations that Bezos’s phone was hacked on 1 May 2018 after he apparently received a video file from a WhatsApp account belonging to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Jeff Bezos met federal investigators in April 2019 after they received information about the alleged hack of the billionaire’s mobile phone by Saudi Arabia, the Guardian has been told."
"THE CONSTELLATION ORION is one of the most recognizable patterns in the night sky, visible around the world. But if you’ve looked at Orion recently and thought something seemed off, you’re not wrong: The giant red star Betelgeuse, which marks the hunter’s right shoulder, is the dimmest it’s been in almost a century. Normally, Betelgeuse is among the 10 brightest stars in the sky. However, the red giant began dimming in October, and by mid-December, the star had faded so much it wasn’t even in the top 20, Villanova University’s Edward Guinan reported in an Astronomer’s Telegram. “Now the outline of Orion is noticeably different with Betelgeuse so faint,” he says. (See how many constellations you can identify with our interactive quiz.) To be clear, dimming alone isn’t all that odd for a star like Betelgeuse. It’s what’s known as a variable star, and its shifts in brightness have been closely studied for decades. However, it is unusual for one of the sky’s most prominent points of light to fade so noticeably, prompting scientists to consider the possibility that something more exciting could be about to happen: Betelgeuse might explode and die, briefly blazing brighter than the full moon before vanishing from our night sky forever. Huge, red stars like Betelgeuse live fast and die violently, exploding in stellar events called supernovae that are visible across vast distances. So, while Betelgeuse is a relatively young star—only about 8.5 million years old—astronomers know that it is nearing the end of its life. “The biggest question now is when it will explode in a supernova,” UC Berkeley’s Sarafina Nance, who studies Betelgeuse and stellar explosions, said on Twitter. “Disclaimer: I don't think it's going to explode any time soon,” she added during an interview with National Geographic. “But I am excited [for] when it does.”","Normally, Betelgeuse is among the 10 brightest stars in the sky. However, the red giant began dimming in October, and by mid-December, the star had faded so much it wasn’t even in the top 20, Villanova University’s Edward Guinan reported in an Astronomer’s Telegram."
"The star, Betelgeuse, is suddenly dimming. It may be a sign, astronomers say, that the star is about to explode. Another possibility is the red supergiant may just be going through a phase. Ed Guinan, an astronomy professor at Villanova University, was the lead author on a December 8 paper entitled ""The Fainting of the Nearby Supergiant Betelgeuse.""He told CNN that Betelgeuse (pronounced: BAY-tel juice) been declining in brightness sharply since October, and was now about 2.5 times fainter than usual. Once the ninth brightest star in the sky, Betelgeuse has fallen now to about the 23rd brightest. Guinan and his colleagues have been closely observing the star for decades, with ""continuous coverage since 1980,"" he said. In the last half-century, the star has never dimmed so aggressively, and that could mean we're on the verge of something extraordinary. ""What causes the supernova is deep inside the star,"" Guinan said. And because the star is so huge, it's impossible to tell what's going on so far down Betelgeuse is the star at the shoulder of Orion, the iconic constellation in the shape of a hunter wielding a bow in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Arabic for ""hand of Orion."" The star, which is about 700 light years away from Earth, is a relatively close neighbor within our galaxy. ""What's special about this is how close it is,"" Guinan said. Guinan said it's the most likely nearby supernova candidate. It's about nine million years old, and stars as large as Betelgeuse don't usually have lifespans past 10 million years. Though its time is nigh, it probably won't explode in your lifetime. ""It'll probably happen in the next 200,000 or 300,000 years,"" Guinan said. It's a variable star, which means it regularly dims and brightens, in cycles that can last about 420 days. Betelgeuse has been in a normal dimming period over the past few months, but it's just dramatically accelerated compared to past years. The dimming process should end by mid-January, according to mathematical models. But Betelgeuse often follows its own rules, he says. ""I personally think it's going to bounce back, but it's fun to watch stars change,"" Guinan said. However, he adds, ""If it continues dimming, then all bets are off."" If it exploded, it would be be bright enough to see during the day That might mean we're on the verge of a brilliant light show, because if a star this close exploded, it would make an impact. Stars rapidly fuse various elements in their cores. And if Betelgeuse burns down to an iron core, which won't fuse, that core could collapse rapidly, leading to a supernova. The red supergiant would glow a vibrant blue for three of four months, and would take about a year to fade out. ""It would be a really bright star visible in the daytime,"" Guinan said. There wouldn't be any direct danger to life on earth, but ultraviolet radiation from the celestial blast could scorch ozone in our atmosphere. Betelgeuse's curious behavior has stuck out in other ways over the decades. In 2009, the late astronomer and Nobel Laureate Charles Townes told CNN he had observed Betelgeuse shrinking 15% since the mid 1990s. Back then, Townes and his colleagues were puzzled because as stars usually get brighter as they shrink. Betelgeuse, however, was dimming. The star has been acting differently in the past few months, and it's anyone guess what all the unusual readings may mean. ""It might then be a very small bright star, or it might even be a black hole. An explosion would be very surprising,"" Townes said at the time.","The star, Betelgeuse, is suddenly dimming. It may be a sign, astronomers say, that the star is about to explode. Another possibility is the red supergiant may just be going through a phase."
"One of the brightest stars in the sky -- the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion -- has gotten significantly less bright than usual in recent months. And that's leading to excited speculation the monster star could soon go supernova. Astronomers from Villanova University in Pennsylvania reported earlier this month that Betelgeuse is at a ""modern all-time low"" magnitude, which is a measure of brightness. An update from the same team on Monday said that the star has continued to dim over the past two weeks: so much, in fact, that it has gone from being one of the top 10 brightest stars in the sky to about the 21st brightest star. One of two things could be happening here: Betelgeuse is a variable star that has been dimming and re-brightening for millennia at this point. We could just be seeing its most significant dip in the past half-century or so, which is less than the blink of an eye in this star's lifespan. Most of the scientists who have chimed in about the big red star in recent weeks on social media believe this is most likely what's going down. ""Stars in the later phases of their life go through a lot of variability that we can't fully explain yet ... It probably still has tens of thousands of years, if not 100,000 (left),"" astronomer Yvette Cendes of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics wrote Friday on Reddit. The other possibility is that Betelgeuse is finally out of fuel and it has begun to collapse in on itself -- a process that is expected to end in a spectacular supernova explosion. Rutgers University physicist Matthew Buckley also jokingly suggested that a highly advanced alien civilization could be to blame for Betelgeuse's recent dimming. ""No one is asking the real question: Is its dimming a sign that someone is finishing a Dyson sphere around it?"" he wrote on Twitter Monday. A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that a super technological society might construct around a star to collect a significant amount of its energy. Imagine something like massive rings of solar panels circling or even encapsulating the sun. Such megastructures have been suggested as possible, if highly unlikely, explanations for the odd behavior of other dimming stars and stars that seem to have disappeared from the sky. The star is hundreds of light years from Earth, which is close in terms of the cosmos, but far enough away that we don't have to worry about being caught up in a supernova blast. There are some interesting studies out that suggest life on Earth has been affected by nearby supernovas in the past, but even if there is some cause for concern there, the good news is that we'll see Betelgeuse blow hundreds of years before the blast reaches Earth. According to astronomer Sten Odenwald, it would be about another 100,00 years before what's left of the explosion and its highly energetic x-rays arrive, and we'll be protected from them by the magnetic fields of our own sun and Earth. When Betelgeuse does go supernova -- as most astronomers believe is inevitable -- it will be a huge show. The exploding star will be visible during daylight and might even be brighter than the moon at night. The last such visible supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova, all the way back in 1604, which was obvious during the day for over three weeks. Betelgeuse is at least 10 times closer to Earth and has a mind-boggling radius that would extend to engulf not only all of our inner solar system if it was put in place of the sun, but also Jupiter. A number of astronomers are making sure to throw lots of cosmic cold water of the notion of Betelgeuse going supernova in the near term. NASA's Eric Mamajek points to research finding the odds of the event happening in the coming decades at about a tenth of a percent and notes that accounts of the star's long history of variable brightening and dimming can even be found in Australian Aboriginal oral tradition. So, we're probably not going to get a second moon in the sky for the holidays, at least not from the direction of Betelgeuse. ""It's not even the star closest to going supernova -- that honor goes to Eta Carinae,"" Cendes says. Eta Carinae is a two-star system about 10 times further away that's already been erupting in its own spectacular death throes for decades now. It may actually be the next star system to light up daytime. Either way, keep an eye on the sky!",One of the brightest stars in the sky -- the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion -- has gotten significantly less bright than usual in recent months. And that's leading to excited speculation the monster star could soon go supernova. 
"An outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan has put health authorities on high alert around the world. It’s led cities to be cordoned off, caused airlines to cancel flights to and from China and has disrupted global business. The World Health Organization declared a global emergency on Jan. 30 as the illness continued to spread, the same day the U.S. issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to visit China. The new coronavirus—named 2019-nCoV—is thought to have originated in the food market of the central China metropolis and has spread to about two dozen countries. Deaths and cases are likely to rise until the outbreak is contained. There have been two deaths outside of mainland China—the first took place in the Philippines on Feb. 1 and the second in Hong Kong was reported by local media on Feb. 4. China first reported the outbreak on Dec. 30. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital. Chinese authorities have restricted some travel to try and stop the illness since Jan. 23 and the country’s financial markets will remain closed until Monday Feb. 3 after the Lunar New Year holiday break was extended. Some cities and provinces have since stretched the holiday to Feb. 10, including Shanghai and Chongqing, while in Hubei the holiday will last until Feb. 14. In Wuhan, public transportation and ride-hailing services have been suspended, trains and flights from the city have been stopped and people have been told to leave only for essential reasons. Similar travel restrictions were announced in more than a dozen other Chinese cities, impacting more than 48 million people. Flight cancellations have skyrocketed since the virus’s outbreak. Nearly one quarter of domestic flights within China never took off on Tuesday, up from 1% a year prior. Most international carriers have announced plans to halt service to China. In the country’s largest cities, the number of flights dropped in half in the past month. Experts are worried that the virus’ mild symptoms will cause those who carry it to unsuspectingly transmit it too far and fast. A 10-year old boy was diagnosed with the coronavirus despite showing no symptoms. The virus has also been transmitted from two infected mothers to their newborn babies in Wuhan. While Ebola kills half the people who get it and SARS killed 10%, the new coronavirus’ mortality rate appears to be only about 2.2%, based on national data from Jan. 20 onwards. It’s still too early to tell how deadly this outbreak will end up being, but the number of patients released from hospital exceeded people who died in China for the first time since Jan. 23 on Saturday.",The new coronavirus—named 2019-nCoV—is thought to have originated in the food market of the central China metropolis and has spread to about two dozen countries. Deaths and cases are likely to rise until the outbreak is contained.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus that has killed at least 490 people in mainland China and two more elsewhere following an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. More than 24,500 cases have been reported worldwide, most of them in China's Hubei province. A man from Wuhan died in the Philippines on February 2 and Hong Kong reported its first death on February 4. The infection is now more widespread than the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which also originated in China, in terms of affected people but not deaths. What is coronavirus? According to the WHO, coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These viruses were originally transmitted between animals and people. SARS, for instance, was believed to have been transmitted from civet cats to humans while MERS travelled from a type of camel to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. The name coronavirus comes from the Latin word corona, meaning crown or halo. Under an electron microscope, the image of the virus is reminiscent of a solar corona. A novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 and named 2019-nCoV, is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. Little is known about it, although human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. What are the symptoms? According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death. The incubation period of the coronavirus remains unknown. Some sources say it could be between 10 and 14 days. How deadly is it? Some experts say it may not be as deadly as other types of coronavirus such as SARS, which killed nearly 800 people worldwide, more than 300 in China alone - during a 2002-2003 outbreak that also originated in China. MERS, which did not spread as widely, was more deadly, killing one-third of those it infected. In China, however, the infection is more widespread than SARS in terms of case numbers. Where have cases been reported? Most cases and deaths have been reported in China - the vast majority in Hubei Province. So far, Hong Kong and the Philippines have reported a death from the new virus outside of mainland China. The virus has spread to many Asian countries, as well as Australia, Europe, North America and the Middle East. The majority of cases outside China are among people who recently travelled there. What is being done to stop it from spreading? Scientists are working on a vaccine but have warned one is unlikely to be available for mass distribution before 2021. Chinese authorities have effectively sealed off Wuhan, and have placed restrictions on travel to and from several other cities, affecting some 56 million people. The move was meant to ""resolutely contain the momentum of the epidemic spreading"" and protect lives, the central city's special command centre against the virus said, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Many airlines have cancelled flights to China, while some countries have banned Chinese nationals from entering and have evacuated their citizens from Wuhan. Chinese health authorities are still trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say likely came from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was also traded illegally. The WHO also says an animal source appears most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak. On February 2, officials in Hubei said the virus had a 96 percent concordance with an already-known bat-borne coronavirus. Chinese scientists previously mentioned snakes as a possible source. Is this a global emergency? The outbreak constitutes a global health emergency, the WHO has said. The decision to sound the top-level alarm was made after the first cases of human-to-human transmission outside China were confirmed. The international health alert is a call on countries around the world to coordinate their response under the guidance of the United Nations health agency. There have been five global health emergencies since 2005 when the declaration was formalised: swine flu in 2009; polio in 2014; Ebola in 2014; Zika in 2016 and Ebola again in 2019.",The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency over a new coronavirus that has killed at least 490 people in mainland China and two more elsewhere following an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
"Can individuals infected with the Wuhan coronavirus spread it to others even if they aren’t showing symptoms? It’s one of the most important questions confronting scientists. If even asymptomatic people can spread the virus, then it will be much, much harder to slow its spread. Doctors in China claimed asymptomatic transmission was possible, and a letter published Jan. 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine appeared to back them up. In the letter, scientists described a cluster of infections in Germany that had started with a traveler from Shanghai. The traveler had seemed healthy during her four-day visit to Bavaria, the researchers reported, and started feeling ill only after she boarded a return flight to China. That report heightened anxiety among scientists worldwide, who said the finding suggested that containment of the Wuhan coronavirus would be nearly impossible. But now health officials in Germany have raised doubts about the accuracy of that report. The visitor to Germany had “mild unspecific symptoms” while she was still in Germany, said Marieke Degen, a spokeswoman with the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s public health institute, headquartered in Berlin. Deaths in China Rise, With No Sign of Slowdown. The woman’s symptoms, including back pain, had been vague, and she had taken antipyretic medication, according to Bavarian health authorities and scientists at the institute. Antipyretic drugs are used not only to relieve fever, but also as painkillers and for their anti-inflammatory properties. Health officials reported their findings last week to the Early Warning and Response System of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ms. Degen said; their criticism was first reported by Science magazine. Whatever the inaccuracies in the journal report, many experts remain concerned about the potential for coronavirus to be spread by asymptomatic individuals, in large part because of anecdotal information received from their colleagues in China. This paper may or may not be flawed — it needs further investigation,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “But I don’t think it negates the concept.” “We had been getting reports from highly reliable people in China — scientists, investigators and public health people who we’ve known over the years — and they’ve been telling us, ‘There’s asymptomatic disease, for sure, and we are seeing asymptomatic transmission,’” Dr. Fauci said. Asymptomatic transmission is unlikely to be driving the epidemic within China, he added, but “it complicates our job.” Even if asymptomatic patients are spreading the coronavirus, the vast majority of infections will occur from patients showing symptoms, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization. Even if asymptomatic patients are spreading the coronavirus, the vast majority of infections will occur from patients showing symptoms, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization. Credit...Denis Balibouse/Reuter If the early symptoms include such common complaints as back pain, then infected individuals and their doctors are unlikely to consider the possibility that the patient is infected with a coronavirus, said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. “From a practical perspective, that is almost the same as if she had no symptoms at all,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “Headaches are very common, and the coronavirus is not the principal cause thereof, and they’re not observable by a third party.” If the first symptom is common and vague, he added, “then the public health challenge of figuring out who’s infectious is about as great as if it was truly asymptomatic.” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of emerging diseases at the World Health Organization, said Tuesday that the organization had been aware of reports of individuals who might have transmitted the Wuhan coronavirus before their symptoms appeared or very soon after being infected. But experience with other diseases indicated that many people who were believed to have been asymptomatic actually did experience symptoms. “It is possible that there may be individuals who are asymptomatic that shed virus, but we need more detailed studies around this to determine how often that is happening, and if this is leading to secondary transmission,” Dr. Van Kerkhove said. Whatever the answers to those questions, however, most viral respiratory infections are spread through the coughs and sneezes of symptomatic patients, experts say. The letter at the center of the controversy describes a healthy 33-year-old businessman in Germany who had developed a sore throat, chills and muscle aches on Jan. 24, with a fever spiking to 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit the next day, along with a cough. Before he became ill, he had met in Munich on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21 with a Chinese business partner. A resident of Shanghai, she had been in Germany from Jan. 19 to Jan. 22. The report said that she was healthy during her stay but got sick during her flight back to China. She tested positive for infection with the Wuhan coronavirus on Jan. 26. Chinese authorities alerted German health officials, and the businessman was tested and found positive for the infection. On Jan. 28, three additional employees of the German company tested positive for the coronavirus. Two of them had not had any contact with the woman from Shanghai. All of the infected were admitted to the hospital, where they were isolated and monitored. None developed severe disease. The authors of the report, researchers in Munich and Berlin, said it was “notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period” of the virus. The woman suffered only a brief, mild illness and recovered. Dr. Michael Hoelscher, one of the authors, told Science magazine that he and his colleagues had not interviewed the Chinese woman who had been ill, and relied on the accounts given by her German colleagues, who said she did not appear to have had any symptoms. Dr. Hoelscher could not be reached for comment. Researchers from the Robert Koch Institute and the Health and Food Safety Authority of Bavaria did interview the woman on the phone, Ms. Degen said, which is how they learned that she might have had symptoms. Julia Morin, a spokeswoman for the New England Journal of Medicine, said, “All we can say right now is that we are looking into the matter.”","In the letter, scientists described a cluster of infections in Germany that had started with a traveler from Shanghai.

"BlackBerry smartphones that are being sold by TCL Communication will soon say goodbye to the market as the Chinese manufacturer has announced that it would be parting ways with the Canadian brand as early as August this year. Existing BlackBerry smartphone users would, however, continue to receive after-sales services until August 31, 2022. In 2016, the Shenzhen-based company signed an agreement to manufacture and sell BlackBerry smartphones -- after BlackBerry decided to shift its focus from the smartphone market. The BlackBerry KEYone, BlackBerry KEY2, and BlackBerry Motion are amongst the BlackBerry handsets that are being designed, manufactured, and sold by TCL Communication in major markets. “The support of BlackBerry Limited was an essential element to bringing devices like BlackBerry KEYone, Motion, KEY2, and KEY2 LE to life and we're proud to have partnered with them these past few years on those projects. We do regret to share however that as of August, 31, 2020, TCL Communication will no longer be selling BlackBerry-branded mobile devices,” the company noted in a statement posted on Twitter. In December 2016, TCL Communication signed the licensing deal with BlackBerry to start designing, manufacturing, and selling BlackBerry-branded smartphones in global markets. That announcement was a follow-up of the revelation that the Waterloo-based company made by specifying its plans to outsource the development of BlackBerry phones in September 2016. Through TCL Communication, the smartphone market received Android-based BlackBerry phones, including the BlackBerry KEYone and BlackBerry KEY2 that both featured a physical keyboard alongside a touchscreen panel. The last phone that the Chinese company brought to the market was the BlackBerry KEY 2 LE that was unveiled in August 2018 and debuted in the Indian market in October 2018. TCL Communication in its statement mentioned that it was “blessed enough” to work on BlackBerry smartphones. However, some online reports highlighted that the company was frustrated and was set to give up for quite some time. Existing BlackBerry smartphone users are promised to receive customer service and warranty until August 31, 2022, adding ""or for as long as required by local laws where the mobile device was purchased."" It is unclear whether the customer service includes any future software updates, though. “The future is bright for both TCL Communication and BlackBerry Limited, and we hope you'll continue to provide support both as we move ahead on our respective paths,” the statement added. Apart from BlackBerry, TCL Communication has other licensed brands on board, including Alcatel and Palm. The latest move isn't likely to impact devices offered by those brands. TCL Communication was notably offering BlackBerry smartphones to select markets, excluding India. In fact, BlackBerry in February 2017 partnered with Optiemus Infracom to specifically produce and sell its Android handsets in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In Indonesia, it had tied up with BB Merah Putih. Gadgets 360 made several attempts to get clarity from Optiemus Infracom on whether it would continue to manufacture and sell BlackBerry smartphones in its operating markets. The company, however, didn't provide any explicit response until the time of filing this story. The last smartphone that Optiemus Infracom brought to the Indian market was the BlackBerry KEY2 LE. It also launched the BlackBerry Power Wireless Charging Pad in the country in March 2019. Given the ongoing circumstances, the future of BlackBerry smartphones is indeed in the dark. TCL Communication, nevertheless, may leverage its experiences with BlackBerry-branded devices to grow its native presence in the smartphone market. The company is already rumoured to have a foldable smartphone in the works that could debut soon to take on the likes of the Motorola Razr (2019) and Samsung Galaxy Fold.",BlackBerry smartphones that are being sold by TCL Communication will soon say goodbye to the market as the Chinese manufacturer has announced that it would be parting ways with the Canadian brand as early as August this year
"Everyone that grew up during the early years of this millennium knows BlackBerry. Often credited with being the world's first maker of the mainstream smartphone, BlackBerry has seen many a heyday, once holding over 20 percent of the global smartphone market and shipping more than 50 million devices every year. However, the iconic Canadian company missed the turn in the millennium that saw the rest of the world run helter skelter towards Android and the dawn of touchscreen smartphones inspired by the equally iconic Steve Jobs. After ceasing to operate its own brand of smartphones in 2016 and licensing its brand to TCL Electronics, BlackBerry has announced on Twitter today that it is severing its partnership from TCL. With no news of a change of hands in partnership, this may well be the end of the way for BlackBerry, once a behemoth in the world of mobile devices. The company has been in the dead, for all intents and purposes. Its last smartphone, the BlackBerry Key2 LE, was unveiled nearly two years ago. In comparison to the fanfare and near frantic hubbub that brands such as Xiaomi, Samsung, Oppo and other leading smartphone players generate, the Key2 LE came — and went — in comparative silence, perhaps speaking a lot about the recent state of the brand. As a result, the announcement from BlackBerry does not come as a surprise. What does strike out, though, is that BlackBerry is not drawing a complete end to its future trysts with smartphones. The company's statement on Twitter says that only its partnership with TCL has ended, suggesting that it remains open to the prospect of a new manufacturing partner, or a comeback in one way or another, in the coming years. That said, it seems unlikely that BlackBerry smartphones will ever be a thing again. While the ever shifting nature of technology means one can never say never, it seems unlikely that the brand will ever scale the heights it once did in the world of mobile devices. BlackBerry Limited will continue operating as it has, and given today's cybersecurity climate and the company's expertise with enterprise security, may see it being in and around the smartphone industry via software only. As for its devices in the market today, BlackBerry has announced that its partner TCL will honour warranties and service requests in respective markets. No word, however, has been said about software updates going forward. Is this the end of BlackBerry's round two, then? Going by information available right now, it certainly feels so.","After ceasing to operate its own brand of smartphones in 2016 and licensing its brand to TCL Electronics, BlackBerry has announced on Twitter today that it is severing its partnership from TCL."
"It appears BlackBerry phones may become a thing of the past. The reason for this is TCL Communications, the company that has the contract to manufacture and sell the BlackBerry phones says the contract is valid only till August 31, 2020. The company will stop selling BlackBerry branded phones post this date though it says it will support the devices sold till that date. TCL has been holding this licence covering practically the entire world. There are very few pockets where other companies hold the rights, but they are really not up to much in terms of making and selling the phone. The licence allowed TCL to design and manufacture the phones and sell under the BlackBerry brand. This ensured the brand stayed alive in the marketplace and kept the brand name in the minds and hearts of the user community. That may not happen now, unless between now and August, BlackBerry finds another manufacturer willing to take on the task from TCL. It has been reported that TCL has developed its own brand and will focus on that after it stops making and selling the Blackberry devices. Experts say TCL had done a decent job of making Android-run smartphones with attractive designs and trying to keep the original Blackberry flavour alive. None of these phones may have turned out to be runaway successes as a model in the highly competitive field, but they were not abject failures either. Indonesia India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh are the markets excluded from the contract TCL had for the BlackBerry brand.","The reason for this is TCL Communications, the company that has the contract to manufacture and sell the BlackBerry phones says the contract is valid only till August 31, 2020.
